    When a teacher launches from an LMS using keys that are configured to for

  description <<-EOS
    Returns JSON of the following form with HTTP status 202:

      `{ job: api_job_path(job_id) }`

    When the job data is retrieved, it will contain a list of errors and a data field.

    Each error in the list will have the following values:

    * `score`: the score that we tried to send.
    * `student_name`: the name of the student for which the error occurred.
    * `student_identifier`: the student's self-supplied student ID
    * `lms_description`: the text returned from the LMS about the error.

    The data field will contain the following values:

    * `num_callbacks`: The number of URL callbacks to the LMS that Tutor has for this course.  This
      is the maximum number of socres that can be sent.
    * `num_missing_scores`: The number of scores that were not found in Tutor (likely because the
      student hasn't worked an assignment or because no assignments have become due)

    The number of errors + `num_missing_scores` should equal `num_callbacks` unless some other
    unhandled error occurred.

    The job progress will be updated during the push.
