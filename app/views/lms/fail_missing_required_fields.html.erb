  <p>Sometimes a school's course management system lets administrators and instructors limit the amount of data sent to external applications.  If you set up your course's use of OpenStax Tutor, please try to include the following fields in the information sent to Tutor.  If an administrator did the setup, please refer him or her to this information.</p>
