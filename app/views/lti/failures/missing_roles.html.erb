  <%# We can't display a shorter error for students here since we are not getting the LTI roles #%>

  Please ensure that your LMS is configured to send the LTI "roles" claim to OpenStax Tutor.
  <br><br>
  Details:
  Sometimes a school's learning management system (LMS) lets administrators and instructors
  limit the data sent to external applications such as OpenStax Tutor.
  If you set up your course's use of OpenStax Tutor,
  please try to include the "roles" LTI claim in the information sent to Tutor.
  If an administrator did the setup, please refer him or her to this information.
