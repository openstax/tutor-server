    This course may not have been integrated correctly. Please notify your instructor.

    The LTI "Client ID" value received from your LMS
    did not match the one configured in OpenStax Tutor.
    If you are doing the initial configuration,
    it is generally safe to change this value by editing the LTI Platform in Tutor.
    If other Tutor courses are already using this LTI Platform,
    you'll need to create a new LTI Platform in OpenStax Tutor and use that one instead.
