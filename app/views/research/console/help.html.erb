<h3>Study Courses</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Courses can only be added to inactive studies</li>
  <li>Courses can only be removed from studies that have <b>never</b> been active</li>
  <li>If you want to remove a course from an active study, your only option is to inactivate the entire study.
      Will do something more nuanced in the future, but this approach is easier for the moment.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cohorts</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Studies do not start with any cohorts.  If a student is admitted to a study without any cohorts, one will be created on the fly.</li>
  <li>Cohorts can only be deleted if they have no members.  You can reassign members to other cohorts to get a cohort so that it has zero members.</li>
  <li>Cohorts have a flag that prevents new members from being assigned to it.</li>
  <li>There is currently not an option to rebalance students across cohorts.  You can effectively achieve this by removing all courses from a study and then adding them back.  Later we will add more rebalancing options.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Survey Plans</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Survey plans don't care if a study is active.  If a survey plan is published, it is visible to students in the study.
      A study's active/inactive state controls whether manipulations are active/inactive.  By not tying survey plans to this
    state, we allow researchers to administer surveys after manipulations are complete.</li>
</ol>
