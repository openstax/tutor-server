# This class will attempt to reserve the Delayed::Job associated with the given ActiveJob
# and run it as soon as the current transaction commits, if it was successfully reserved
# If this is the same transaction that created the Delayed::Job, the reserve step should never fail
# If there is no ongoing transaction, the Delayed::Job is run immediately, if reserved successfully
