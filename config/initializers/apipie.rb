    Access to the API must be achieved through an OAuth flow or by having a user
    that is logged in to the system (with a session, etc).

    When communicating with the API, developers must set a header in the
    HTTP request to specify which version of the API they want to use:

    <table class='std-list-1' style='width: 80%; margin: 15px auto'>
      <tr>
        <th>Header Name</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Version Accessed</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>'Accept'</code></td>
        <td><code>'application/vnd.exercises.openstax.v1'</code></td>
        <td>v1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    Many of the API specifications provide a related JSON schema.
    These schemas are based on the standard defined at
    [http://json-schema.org/](http://json-schema.org/).
    A lot of these schemas aren't overly specific to the actions they are listed under,
    e.g. they always say that an `id` is required but that isn't the case when
    new data is being posted to a `create` call.
