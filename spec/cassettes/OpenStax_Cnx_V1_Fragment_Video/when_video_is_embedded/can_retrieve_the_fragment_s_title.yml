        id=\"eip-305\"><span data-type=\"term\">Force</span> is the cause of motion,
        and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a
        dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a
        satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes
        the way objects move&#8212;their velocity and their acceleration. <span data-type=\"term\">Dynamics</span>
        considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems.
        Newton&#8217;s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe
        the way that objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with
        other objects. They are also universal laws in that they apply everywhere
        on Earth as well as in space.</p><p id=\"eip-832\">A force pushes or pulls
        an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object
        such as a table, or an animate object such as a person. The pushing or pulling
        may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of the earth. Forces
        have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are
        stronger than others and can point in different directions. For example, a
        cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air.
        In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your
        arm. </p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" id=\"fs-id1172194442505\" class=\"ost-assessed-feature

        multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all
        of the forces acting on an object gives the total, or <span data-type=\"term\">net
        force</span>. An <span data-type=\"term\">external force</span> is a force
        that acts on an object inside of the system from outside of the system. This
        is different than an internal force, which acts between objects that are both
        within the system. The <span data-type=\"term\">net external force</span>
        combines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We
        go into more detail about net force, external force, and net external force
        in the coming sections. In mathematical terms, two forces acting in opposite
        directions have opposite signs (positive or negative). By convention, the
        negative sign is assigned to movement to the left or downward. If two forces
        pushing in opposite directions are added together, the larger force will be
        somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite direction.
        It is important to be consistent with your chosen coordinate system within
        a problem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the downward direction
        for velocity, then distance, force and acceleration should also be designated
        as negative in the downward direction.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" id=\"eip-534\"

        represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only
        ones shown because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion.
        We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each
        other out, as Newton&#8217;s third law will show. Free-body diagrams are very
        useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"eip-824\">Here

        shows the force of tension acting in the upward direction, opposite the force
        of gravity. These forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow
        pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing
        gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative
        magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Since forces are vectors, they add
        just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in
        <a href=\"#eip-idp140653750160320\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>,
        which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude.
        Since these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are
        perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.</p><p
        id=\"eip-287\">Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on
        something. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a
        magnet in the case of magnetic force or the gravitational pull of the earth
        in the case of gravitational force.</p><p id=\"eip-217\">In the next three
        sections on Newton&#8217;s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific
        types of forces&#8212;friction, the normal force, and the gravitational force.
        To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams
        to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.</p>\n\n<div
