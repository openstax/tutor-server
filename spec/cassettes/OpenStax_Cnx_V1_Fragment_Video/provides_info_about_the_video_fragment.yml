        id=\"eip-545\">At first glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday
        experience. You have probably noticed that a moving object will usually slow
        down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding
        why, for example, a sliding box slows down (seemingly on its own) is that
        a net external force acts on it to make it slow down. Without this net external
        force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity (as stated in
        Newton&#8217;s first law of motion). What force acts on the box to slow it
        down? It is called <span data-type=\"term\">friction</span>. Friction is an
        external force that acts opposite to the direction of motion (see <a href=\"#eip-idm20864848\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). Think of it as a resistance to
        motion that slows things down.</p><p id=\"eip-66\">Friction:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"eip-idp86047488\"

        </h2><p id=\"eip-370\">Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned
        off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it to a stop.
        However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck slightly so that the
        puck experiences very little friction as it moves over the surface. With friction
        almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very little change in speed.
        On a frictionless surface, the puck would experience no net external force
        (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction). Additionally,
        if we know enough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects
        will slow down.</p>\n\n<p id=\"eip-114\">Now let&#8217;s think about another
        example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant velocity by applying
        a force of +50 N (the positive sign indicates by convention that the direction
        of motion is to the right). What is the force of friction that opposes the
        motion? The force of friction must be &#8722;50 N. Why? According to Newton&#8217;s
        first law of motion, any object moving at constant velocity has no net external
        force acting upon it, which means that the sum of the forces acting on the
        object must be zero. The mathematical way to say that no net external force
        acts on an object is <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>MATH</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml
        encoding=\"MathML-Content\"><mtext>MATH</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math>
        , or <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>MATH</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml
        encoding=\"MathML-Content\"><mtext>MATH</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math>
        . So if the man applies +50 N of force, then the force of friction must be
        &#8722;50 N for the two forces to add up to zero (i.e., &#8220;cancel&#8221;
        each other). Whenever you encounter the phrase &#8220;at constant velocity,&#8221;
        Newton&#8217;s first law tells you that the net external force is zero.</p><figure

        force of friction depends on two things: the coefficient of friction and the

        nature of the surfaces in contact with one another. The normal force is the
        force exerted by a surface that pushes on an object in response to gravity
        pulling the object down. In equation form, the force of friction is <div data-type=\"equation\"

        &#956; is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The coefficient
        of friction is discussed in more detail in the next chapter and the normal
        force is discussed in more detail in section four of this chapter.\n</p><p
        id=\"eip-89\">Recall from section one that a net external force acts from
        outside on the object of interest. A more precise definition is that it acts
        on the <span data-type=\"term\">system</span> of interest. A system is one
        or more objects that you choose to study. It is important to define the system
        at the beginning of a problem to figure out which forces are external and
        need to be considered and which are internal and can be ignored.</p><p id=\"eip-826\">For
        example, in <a href=\"#eip-idm20864848\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>
        (a), two children push a third child in a wagon at constant velocity. The
        system of interest is the wagon plus the small child shown in part b of the
        figure. The two children behind the wagon exert external forces on this system
        (<em data-effect=\"italics\">F</em><sub>1</sub>, <em data-effect=\"italics\">F</em><sub>2</sub>).
        Friction <em data-effect=\"italics\">f</em> acting at the axles of the wheels
        and at the surface where the wheels touch the ground is another external force
        acting on the system. Two more external forces act on the system: the weight
        <em data-effect=\"italics\">W</em> of the system pulling down and the normal
        force <em data-effect=\"italics\">N</em> of the ground pushing up. Notice
        that the wagon is not accelerating vertically, so Newton&#8217;s first law
        tells us that the normal force balances the weight. Because the wagon is moving
        forward at constant velocity, then the force of friction must have the same
        strength as the sum of the forces applied by the two children.</p><figure
        id=\"eip-idm20864848\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-k12phys-ch04-s02-lo01\"><figcaption>(a)
        The wagon and rider form a &#8220;system&#8221; that is acted on by external
        forces. (b)The two children pushing the wagon and child provide two external
        forces. Friction acting at the wheel axles and on the surface of the tires
        where they touch the ground provides an external force that acts against the
        direction of motion. The weight <em data-effect=\"italics\">W</em> and the
        normal force <em data-effect=\"italics\">N</em> from the ground are two more
        external forces acting on the system. All external forces are represented
        in the figure by arrows. All of the external forces acting on the system add
        together, but because the wagon moves at a constant velocity, all the forces
        must add up to zero.</figcaption><span data-type=\"media\" id=\"eip-idp5554688\"

        data-type=\"term\">Inertia</span> is the tendency for an object at rest to
        remain at rest or for a moving object to remain in motion in a straight line
        with constant speed. This key property of objects was first described by Galileo.
        Later, Newton incorporated the concept of inertia into his first law, which
        is often referred to as the <span data-type=\"term\">law of inertia</span>.</p><p
        id=\"eip-36\">As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than
        others. For example, changing the motion of a large truck is more difficult
        than changing the motion of a toy truck. In fact, the inertia of an object
        is proportional to the mass of the object. <span data-type=\"term\">Mass</span>
        is a measure of the amount of matter (or &#8220;stuff&#8221;) in something.
        The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by the number
        and type of atoms it contains. Unlike weight (which changes if the gravitational
        force changes), mass does not depend on gravity. The mass of an object is
        the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. In practice, it
        is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in
        an object, so mass is usually not determined this way. Instead, the mass of
        an object is determined by comparing it with the standard kilogram. Mass is

        rope (by clicking people and dragging them with your mouse). Experiment with
        changing the number and size of people on each side to see how it affects

        on the Friction tab. Try selecting different objects for the person to push.
        Slide the applied force button to the right to apply force to the right and
        to the left to apply force to the left. The force will continue to be applied
        as long as you hold the button down. See the arrow representing friction change
        in magnitude and direction depending on how much force you apply. Try increasing
        or decreasing the friction force to see how this affects the motion.</p>\n<div
