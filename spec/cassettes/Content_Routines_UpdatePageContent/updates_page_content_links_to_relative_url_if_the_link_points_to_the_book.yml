        id=\"import-auto-id2510075\">The range of objects and phenomena studied in
        physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus to the
        age of the Earth, from the tiny sizes of sub-nuclear particles to the vast
        distance to the edges of the known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping
        flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10
        to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving
        numerical values for physical quantities and equations for physical principles
        allows us to understand nature much more deeply than does qualitative description
        alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in
        which to express them. And we shall find that (even in the potentially mundane
        discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds) a profound simplicity of nature
        appears&#8212;all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of
        only four fundamental physical quantities: length, mass, time, and electric
        current.</p><p id=\"import-auto-id1675918\">We define a <span data-type=\"term\"
        id=\"import-auto-id1536256\">physical quantity</span> either by  <em data-effect=\"italics\">specifying
        how it is measured</em> or by <em data-effect=\"italics\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">stating
        how it is calculated</em></em> from other measurements. For example, we define
        distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, whereas we define
        <em data-effect=\"italics\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">average speed</em></em>
        by stating that it is calculated as distance traveled divided by time of travel.</p>\n    <p

        in terms of <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id1666000\">units</span>,
        which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is
        a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or
        kilometers (for distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be
        extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values
        in a meaningful way. (See <a href=\"#import-auto-id2991258\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>.)</p>\n    \n    <figure

        system) and <span data-type=\"term\">English units</span> (also known as the
        customary or imperial system). <strong>English units</strong> were historically
        used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used
        in the United States. Virtually every other country in the world now uses
        SI units as the standard; the metric system is also the standard system agreed
        upon by scientists and mathematicians. The acronym &#8220;SI&#8221; is derived

        is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than
        others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined <em
        data-effect=\"italics\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">only</em></em> in terms
        of the procedure used to measure them. The units in which they are measured
        are thus called <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id3097983\">fundamental
        units</span>. In this textbook, the fundamental physical quantities are taken
        to be length, mass, time, and electric current. (Note that electric current
        will not be introduced until much later in this text.) All other physical
        quantities, such as force and electric charge, can be expressed as algebraic
        combinations of length, mass, time, and current (for example, speed is length
        divided by time); these units are called <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id1950609\">derived

        s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean
        solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy
        and to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical
        phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer due to very gradual slowing
        of the Earth&#8217;s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very
        steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967
        the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations.
        (See <a href=\"#import-auto-id2575847\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>.)
        Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, because all measurements are
        ultimately expressed in terms of fundamental units and can be no more accurate
        than are the fundamental units themselves.</p>\n    \n    <figure id=\"import-auto-id2575847\"><figcaption>An

        the <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id1629056\">meter</span> (abbreviated
        m); its definition has also changed over time to become more accurate and
        precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance
        from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889
        by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a
        platinum-iridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible
        to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of light,
        so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted
        by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition (partly
        for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458
        of a second. (See <a href=\"#import-auto-id1381492\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>.)
        This change defines the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 meters per
        second. The length of the meter will change if the speed of light is someday
        measured with greater accuracy.</p></section>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id2786029\"><h2

        id=\"import-auto-id2678122\">metric system</span>. The metric system is convenient
        for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized
        by factors of 10. <a href=\"#import-auto-id2643474\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>
        gives metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors of 10.</p>\n    <p
        id=\"import-auto-id1309728\">Metric systems have the advantage that conversions
        of units involve only powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter,
        1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the system
        of U.S. customary units, the relationships are not as simple&#8212;there are
        12 inches in a foot, 5280 feet in a mile, and so on. Another advantage of
        the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges
        of values simply by using an appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances
        in meters are suitable in construction, while distances in kilometers are
        appropriate for air travel, and the tiny measure of nanometers are convenient
        in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent new units
        for particular applications.</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id1577727\">The

        Standards for Basic Units</div>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id1113253\">The fundamental
        units described in this chapter are those that produce the greatest accuracy
        and precision in measurement. There is a sense among physicists that, because
        there is an underlying microscopic substructure to matter, it would be most
        satisfying to base our standards of measurement on microscopic objects and
        fundamental physical phenomena such as the speed of light. A microscopic standard
        has been accomplished for the standard of time, which is based on the oscillations
        of the cesium atom.</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id2596896\">The standard
        for length was once based on the wavelength of light (a small-scale length)
        emitted by a certain type of atom, but it has been supplanted by the more
        precise measurement of the speed of light. If it becomes possible to measure
        the mass of atoms or a particular arrangement of atoms such as a silicon sphere
        to greater precision than the kilogram standard, it may become possible to
        base mass measurements on the small scale. There are also possibilities that
        electrical phenomena on the small scale may someday allow us to base a unit
        of charge on the charge of electrons and protons, but at present current and
        charge are related to large-scale currents and forces between wires.</p></div>\n    \n    <table

        of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or, perhaps you are reading
        walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in
        how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you will need to convert
        units of feet to miles.</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id1430021\">Let us consider
        a simple example of how to convert units. Let us say that we want to convert
        80 meters (m) to kilometers (km).</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id1595008\">The
        first thing to do is to list the units that you have and the units that you
        want to convert to. In this case, we have units in <em data-effect=\"italics\"><em
        data-effect=\"italics\">meters</em></em> and we want to convert to <em data-effect=\"italics\"><em
        data-effect=\"italics\">kilometers</em></em>.</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id3083046\">Next,
        we need to determine a <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id2657858\">conversion
        factor</span> relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio
        expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there
        are 12 inches in 1 foot, 100 centimeters in 1 meter, 60 seconds in 1 minute,
        and so on. In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.</p>\n    <p
        id=\"import-auto-id2675967\">Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will
        write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor
        so that the units cancel out, as shown:</p>\n    <div data-type=\"equation\"

        Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem
        asked us to solve for average speed in units of km/h and we have indeed obtained
        these units.</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id1552604\">(3) Check the significant
        figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant
        figures, the answer should also have three significant figures. The answer
        30.0 km/hr does indeed have three significant figures, so this is appropriate.
        Note that the significant figures in the conversion factor are not relevant
        because an hour is <em data-effect=\"italics\">defined</em> to be 60 minutes,
        so the precision of the conversion factor is perfect.</p><p id=\"import-auto-id3089353\">(4)
        Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information
        from the problem&#8212;if you travel 10 km in a third of an hour (20 min),
        you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem reasonable.</p>\n    <p

        Start with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors
        are needed&#8212;one to convert hours to seconds, and another to convert kilometers
        to meters.</p>\n    <p id=\"import-auto-id1324707\">(2) Multiplying by these

        underlying its behavior, the next few chapters will be devoted to electric
        and magnetic phenomena involving current. In addition to exploring applications
