        id=\"fs-idp3596416\"><span data-type=\"term\">Newton&#8217;s first law of
        motion</span> states that:</p>\n<ol id=\"fs-idm15224208\" data-number-style=\"arabic\">\n<li>A
        body at rest tends to remain at rest.</li>\n<li>A body in motion tends to
        remain in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.
        (Recall that &#8220;constant velocity&#8221; means the body moves in a straight
        line and at a constant speed.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"fs-idp76991328\">At first
        glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday experience. You have
        probably noticed that a moving object will usually slow down and stop unless
        some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding why, for example,
        a sliding box slows down (seemingly on its own) is to first understand that
        a net external force acts on the box to make the box slow down. Without this
        net external force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity
        (as stated in Newton&#8217;s first law of motion). What force acts on the
        box to slow it down? It is called <span data-type=\"term\">friction</span>.
        Friction is an external force that acts opposite to the direction of motion,
        as shown in the following figure. Think of it as a resistance to motion that
        slows things down.</p><p id=\"fs-idp88293152\">Consider an air hockey table.
        When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction
        slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck
        slightly, so that the puck experiences very little friction as it moves over
        the surface. With friction almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very
        little change in speed. On a frictionless surface, the puck would experience
        no net external force (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction).
        Additionally, if we know enough about friction, we can accurately predict
        how quickly objects will slow down.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp90640208\">Now let&#8217;s
        think about another example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant
        velocity by applying a force of +50 N. (The positive sign indicates that,
        by convention, the direction of motion is to the right.) What is the force
        of friction that opposes the motion? The force of friction must be &#8722;50
        N. Why? According to Newton&#8217;s first law of motion, any object moving
        at constant velocity has no net external force acting upon it, which means
        that the sum of the forces acting on the object must be zero. The mathematical
        way to say that no net external force acts on an object is <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

        </mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math> So if the man applies +50 N of
        force, then the force of friction must be &#8722;50 N for the two forces to
        add up to zero (that is, for the two forces to &#8220;cancel&#8221; each other).
        Whenever you encounter the phrase &#8220;at constant velocity,&#8221; Newton&#8217;s
        first law tells you that the net external force is zero. </p><figure id=\"Figure_04_02_friction\"

        in this chapter.)</p><p id=\"fs-idp6638384\">Recall from the section on Force
        that a net external force acts from outside on the object of interest. A more
        precise definition is that it acts on the <span data-type=\"term\">system</span>
        of interest. A system is one or more objects that you choose to study. It
        is important to define the system at the beginning of a problem to figure
        out which forces are external and need to be considered and which are internal
        and can be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp62008448\">As shown in figure below,
        part (a), two children push a third child in a wagon at constant velocity.
        The system of interest is the wagon plus the small child, as shown in part
        (b) of the figure. The two children behind the wagon exert external forces
        on this system (<em data-effect=\"italics\">F</em>1, <em data-effect=\"italics\">F</em>2).
        Friction <em data-effect=\"italics\">f</em> acting at the axles of the wheels
        and at the surface where the wheels touch the ground is another external force
        acting on the system. Two more external forces act on the system: the <span
        data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\">weight</span> <em data-effect=\"italics\">W</em>
        of the system pulling down and the normal force <em data-effect=\"italics\">N</em>
        of the ground pushing up. Notice that the wagon is not accelerating vertically,
        so Newton&#8217;s first law tells us that the normal force balances the weight.
        Because the wagon is moving forward at constant velocity, the force of friction
        must have the same strength as the sum of the forces applied by the two children.</p><figure
        id=\"Figure_04_02_wagon\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-phys-ch04-s02-lo01\"><figcaption>(a)
        The wagon and rider form a &#8220;system&#8221; that is acted on by external
        forces. (b)The two children pushing the wagon and child provide two external
        forces. Friction acting at the wheel axles and on the surface of the tires
        where they touch the ground provides an external force that acts against the
        direction of motion. The weight <em data-effect=\"italics\">W</em> and the
        normal force <em data-effect=\"italics\">N</em> from the ground are two more
        external forces acting on the system. All external forces are represented
        in the figure by arrows. All of the external forces acting on the system add
        together, but because the wagon moves at a constant velocity, all the forces

        wheels. Place a heavy weight in one of them. Ask students which cart would
        require more force to change its state of motion. Ask students which would
        stay in motion longer if you were to set them in motion. Based on this discussion,
        have students speculate what inertia may depend on.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp6331776\"><span

        Explain the concepts of mass and weight. Explain that these terms may be used
        interchangeably in everyday life but have different meanings in science.</p>\n</div>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idp76475072\"><span data-type=\"term\">Inertia</span> is the tendency
        for an object at rest to remain at rest, or for a moving object to remain
        in motion in a straight line with constant speed. This key property of objects
        was first described by Galileo. Later, Newton incorporated the concept of
        inertia into his first law, which is often referred to as the <span data-type=\"term\">law
        of inertia</span>.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idp18457520\">As we know from experience,
        some objects have more inertia than others. For example, changing the motion
        of a large truck is more difficult than changing the motion of a toy truck.
        In fact, the inertia of an object is proportional to the mass of the object.
        <span data-type=\"term\">Mass</span> is a measure of the amount of matter
        (or &#8220;stuff&#8221;) in an object. The quantity or amount of matter in
        an object is determined by the number and types of atoms the object contains.
        Unlike weight (which changes if the gravitational force changes), mass does
        not depend on gravity. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit,
        or on the surface of the moon. In practice, it is very difficult to count
        and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object, so mass is usually
        not determined this way. Instead, the mass of an object is determined by comparing
        it with the standard kilogram. Mass is therefore expressed in kilograms.</p>\n<div

        rope (by clicking people and dragging them with your mouse). Experiment with
        changing the number and size of people on each side to see how it affects

        click on the Friction tab. Try selecting different objects for the person

        right and to the left to apply force to the left. The force will continue
        to be applied as long as you hold down the button. See the arrow representing
        friction change in magnitude and direction, depending on how much force you
        apply. Try increasing or decreasing the friction force to see how this change
