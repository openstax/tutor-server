        data-type=\"title\">Scientific Methods</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355734421\">Scientists
        often plan and carry out investigations to answer questions about the universe
        around us. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe, meaning that humans did
        not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover and understand
        them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery,
        imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative
        effort. The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation. Science
        must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine or wish it to be.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164355753146\">We all are curious to some extent. We look around,
        make generalizations, and try to understand what we see. For example, we look
        up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become
        serious about exploring nature, we become more organized and formal in collecting
        and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision, perform controlled experiments
        (if we can), and write down ideas about how data may be organized. We then
        formulate models, theories, and laws based on the data we have collected,
        and communicate those results with others. This, in a nutshell, describes
        the <span data-type=\"term\">scientific method</span>, a term used for the
        techniques that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis
        of evidence from observation and experiment.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355748890\">An
        investigation often begins with a scientist making an <span data-type=\"term\">observation</span>.
        The scientist observes a pattern or trend within the natural world. Observation
        may generate questions that the scientist wishes to answer. Next, the scientist
        may perform some research about the topic and devise a <span data-type=\"term\">hypothesis</span>.
        A hypothesis is a testable statement that describes how something in the natural
        world works. In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something
        about an observation.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"
        id=\"fs-id1164356044398\" class=\"note os-teacher\" data-label=\"Teacher Support\">\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164355724534\"><span class=\"ost-level-on\">[OL]</span>Educated
        guess is used throughout this section in describing a hypothesis to combat
        the tendency to think of a theory as an educated guess.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164355746249\">Scientists may test the hypothesis by performing
        an <span data-type=\"term\">experiment</span>. During an experiment, the scientist
        collects data that will help them learn about the phenomenon they are studying.
        Then the scientists analyze the results of the experiment (that is, the data),
        often using statistical, mathematical, and/or graphical methods. From the
        data analysis, they draw conclusions. They may conclude that their experiment
        either supports or rejects their hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported,
        the scientist usually goes on to test another hypothesis related to the first.
        If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then test a new and different
        hypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying.</p>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164355882653\">Scientific processes can be applied to many situations.
        Let&#8217;s say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You
        have just made an observation! You ask yourself, \"Why won&#8217;t my car
        start?\" You can now use scientific processes to answer this question. First,
        you generate a hypothesis such as, \"The car won&#8217;t start because it
        has no gasoline in the gas tank.\" To test this hypothesis, you put gasoline
        in the car and try to start it again. If the car starts, then your hypothesis
        is supported by the experiment. If the car does not start, then your hypothesis
        is rejected. You will then need to think up a new hypothesis to test such
        as, \"My car won&#8217;t start because the fuel pump is broken.\" Hopefully,
        your experiments lead you to discover why the car won&#8217;t start, and enable
        you to fix it.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1164356023247\"

        id=\"fs-id1164355853097\">A <span data-type=\"term\">model</span> is a representation
        of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly.
        Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs,
        or simulations&#8212;computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are
        especially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena
        that we normally cannot observe with our senses, such as very small objects
        or objects that move at high speeds. For example, we can understand the structure
        of an atom using models, despite the fact that no one has ever seen an atom
        with their own eyes. Models are always approximate, so they are simpler to
        consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated
        it must be. Models put the intangible or the extremely complex into human
        terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355591169\"><span
        data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\">Scientific models</span> are constructed
        based on the results of previous experiments. Even still, models often only
        describe a phenomenon partially or in a few limited situations. Some phenomena
        are so complex that it may be impossible to model it in its entirety, even
        using computers. An example is the <span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\">electron
        cloud model</span> of the atom in which electrons are moving around the atom&#8217;s
        center in distinct clouds. (See <a href=\"#Figure_01_02_electron\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>)
        that represent the likelihood of finding an electron in different places.
        This model helps us to visualize the structure of an atom. However, it does
        not show us exactly where an electron will be within its cloud at any one
        particular time.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"Figure_01_02_electron\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-phys-ch01-s02-lo02\"><figcaption>The
        electron cloud model of the atom predicts the geometry and shape of areas
        where different electrons may be found in an atom. However, it cannot indicate
        exactly where an electron will be at any one time.</figcaption>\n<span data-type=\"media\"
        id=\"fs-id1164355691661\" data-alt=\"A drawing of an electron cloud model

        electrons surround the nucleus.\"/>\n</span>\n\n</figure>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355743525\">As
        mentioned previously, physicists use a variety of models including equations,
        physical models, computer simulations, etc. For example, <span data-type=\"term\"
        class=\"no-emphasis\">three-dimensional models</span> are often commonly used
        in chemistry and physics to model molecules. Properties other than appearance
        or location are usually modelled using mathematics, where functions are used
        to show how these properties relate to one another. Processes such as the
        formation of a star or the planets, can also be modelled using computer simulations.
        Once a simulation is correctly programmed based on actual experimental data,
        the simulation can allow us to view processes that happened in the past or
        happen too quickly or slowly for us to observe directly. In addition, scientists
        can also run virtual experiments using <span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\">computer
        based models</span>. In a model of planet formation, for example, the scientist
        could alter the amount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects
        planet formation.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355916579\">Scientists use models
        and experimental results to construct explanations of observations or design
        solutions to problems. For example, one way to make a car more fuel efficient
        is to reduce the friction or drag caused by air flowing around the moving
        car. This can be done by designing the body shape of the car to be more aerodynamic,
        such as by using rounded corners instead of sharp ones. Engineers can then
        construct <span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\">physical models</span>
        of the car body, place them in a wind tunnel, and examine the flow of air
        around the model (This can also be done mathematically in a computer simulation).
        The air flow pattern can be analyzed for regions smooth air flow and for eddies
        that indicate drag. The model of the car body may have to be altered slightly
        to produce the smoothest pattern of air flow (i.e., the least drag). The pattern
        with the least drag may be the solution to increasing fuel efficiency of the
        car. This solution might then be incorporated into the car design.</p>\n\n<div

        of their model by placing weathervanes that they have constructed around the
        room and opening a window or door. By observing the weather vanes, students
        will see how air actually flows through the room from a specific window or
        door. Students will then correct their model based on their experimental evidence.
        The material list is given per group:\n<div data-type=\"list\" data-list-type=\"bulleted\"
        id=\"fs-id1164355973500\">\n<div data-type=\"item\">One room with at least

        <span data-type=\"term\">scientific law</span> is a description of a pattern
        in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been studied. That is,
        physical laws are meant to be <span data-type=\"term\">universal</span>, meaning
        that they apply throughout the known universe. Laws are often also concise,
        whereas theories are more complicated. A law can be expressed in the form
        of a single sentence or mathematical equation. For example, <span data-type=\"term\"
        class=\"no-emphasis\">Newton&#8217;s second law of motion</span>, which relates
        the motion of an object to the force applied (<em data-effect=\"italics\">F</em>),
        the mass of the object (<em data-effect=\"italics\">m</em>), and the object&#8217;s
        acceleration (<em data-effect=\"italics\">a</em>), is simply stated using
        the equation:</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"equation\" id=\"fs-id1164356013838\"

        id=\"fs-id1164355729378\">Scientific ideas and explanations that are true
        in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called <span data-type=\"term\">principles</span>.
        An example is <span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\">Pascal&#8217;s
        principle</span>, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or
        gases. However, the distinction between laws and principles is sometimes not
        carefully made in science.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355994030\">A <span data-type=\"term\">theory</span>
        is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by much scientific
        evidence and verified multiple times by multiple researchers. While many people
        confuse theories with educated guesses o hypotheses, theories have withstood
        more rigorous testing and verification than hypotheses.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\"

        data-label=\"Teacher Support\">\n<p id=\"fs-id1164355681426\"><span class=\"ost-level-on\">[OL]</span>Explain
        to students that in informal, everyday English the word \"theory\" can be
        used to describe an idea that is possibly true but that has not been proven
        to be true. This use of the word \"theory\" often leads people to think that
        scientific theories are nothing more than educated guesses. This is not just
        a misconception among students, but among the general public as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164356023117\">As a closing idea about scientific processes, we
        want to point out that scientific laws and theories, even those that have
        been supported by experiments for centuries, can still be changed by new discoveries.
        This is especially true when new technologies emerge that allow us to observe
        things that were formerly unobservable. Imagine how viewing previously invisible
        objects with a microscope or viewing Earth for the first time from space may
        have instantly changed our scientific theories and laws! What discoveries
        still await us in the future? The constant retesting and perfecting of our
        scientific laws and theories allows our knowledge of nature to progress. For
        this reason, many scientists are reluctant to say that their studies \"prove\"
        anything. By saying \"support\" instead of \"prove,\" it keeps the door open
        for future discoveries, even if they won&#8217;t occur for centuries or even
        millennia.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id1164355714220\"

        the word \"prove,\" the general public knows that science has proven certain
        things such as that the heart pumps blood and the Earth is round. However,
        scientists should shy away from using \"prove\" because it is impossible to
        test every single instance and every set of conditions in a system to absolutely
        prove anything. Using \"support\" or similar terminology leaves the door open
