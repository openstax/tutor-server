        suggests that an object at rest will remain at rest if left alone, and that
        an object in motion tends to slow down and stop unless some effort is made
        to keep it moving. What <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id1777407\">Newton&#8217;s

        states, however, is the following:</p>\n      \n        <div data-type=\"note\"
        data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id2690663\" data-label=\"\"><div data-type=\"title\">Newton&#8217;s
        First Law of Motion</div>\n        <p id=\"fs-id1694182\">A body at rest remains
        at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless
        acted on by a net external force. </p></div>\n        <p id=\"import-auto-id1741367\">Note
        the repeated use of the verb &#8220;remains.&#8221; We can think of this law
        as preserving the status quo of motion. </p>\n        <p id=\"import-auto-id1904217\">Rather
        than contradicting our experience, <span data-type=\"term\">Newton&#8217;s
        first law of motion</span> states that there must be a <em data-effect=\"italics\">cause</em>
        (which is a net external force) <em data-effect=\"italics\">for there to be
        any change in velocity (either a change in magnitude or direction)</em>. We
        will define <em data-effect=\"italics\">net external force</em> in the next
        section. An object sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net
        force of friction acting on the object. If friction disappeared, would the
        object still slow down?</p><p id=\"import-auto-id1416969\">The idea of cause
        and effect is crucial in accurately describing what happens in various situations.
        For example, consider what happens to an object sliding along a rough horizontal
        surface. The object quickly grinds to a halt. If we spray the surface with
        talcum powder to make the surface smoother, the object slides farther. If
        we make the surface even smoother by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object
        slides farther yet. Extrapolating to a frictionless surface, we can imagine
        the object sliding in a straight line indefinitely. Friction is thus the <em
        data-effect=\"italics\">cause</em> <em data-effect=\"italics\"><!-- no-selfclose
        --></em>of the slowing (consistent with Newton&#8217;s first law). The object
        would not slow down at all if friction were completely eliminated. Consider
        an air hockey table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short
        distance before friction slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned
        on, it creates a nearly frictionless surface, and the puck glides long distances
        without slowing down. Additionally, if we know enough about the friction,
        we can accurately predict how quickly the object will slow down. Friction
        is an external force. </p><p id=\"import-auto-id1486790\">Newton&#8217;s first
        law is completely general and can be applied to anything from an object sliding
        on a table to a satellite in orbit to blood pumped from the heart. Experiments
        have thoroughly verified that any change in velocity (speed or direction)
        must be caused by an external force. The idea of <em data-effect=\"italics\">generally
        applicable or universal laws</em> is important not only here&#8212;it is a
        basic feature of all laws of physics. Identifying these laws is like recognizing
        patterns in nature from which further patterns can be discovered. The genius
        of Galileo, who first developed the idea for the first law, and Newton, who
        clarified it, was to ask the fundamental question, &#8220;What is the cause?&#8221;
        Thinking in terms of cause and effect is a worldview fundamentally different
        from the typical ancient Greek approach when questions such as &#8220;Why
        does a tiger have stripes?&#8221; would have been answered in Aristotelian
        fashion, &#8220;That is the nature of the beast.&#8221; True perhaps, but
        not a useful insight.</p>\n      \n        <section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1737594\"><h3
        data-type=\"title\">Mass</h3>\n        <p id=\"import-auto-id2712510\">The
        property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant
        velocity is called <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id2134480\">inertia</span>.
        Newton&#8217;s first law is often called the <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id1408275\">law
        of inertia</span>. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia
        than others. It is obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large
        boulder than that of a basketball, for example. The inertia of an object is
        measured by its <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"import-auto-id1500464\">mass</span>.
        Roughly speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of &#8220;stuff&#8221; (or
        matter) in something. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined
        by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it contains. Unlike
        weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same
        on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. In practice, it is very
        difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object,
        so masses are not often determined in this manner. Operationally, the masses
        of objects are determined by comparison with the standard kilogram.</p></section>\n        <div
