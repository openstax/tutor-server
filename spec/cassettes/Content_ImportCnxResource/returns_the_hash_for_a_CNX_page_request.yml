        id=\"eip-305\"><span data-type=\"term\">Force</span> is the cause of motion,
        and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a
        dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a
        satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes
        the way objects move&#8212;their velocity and their acceleration. <span data-type=\"term\">Dynamics</span>
        considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems.
        Newton&#8217;s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe
        the way that objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with
        other objects. They are also universal laws in that they apply everywhere
        on Earth as well as in space.</p><p id=\"eip-832\">A force pushes or pulls
        an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object
        such as a table, or an animate object such as a person. The pushing or pulling
        may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of the earth. Forces
        have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are
        stronger than others and can point in different directions. For example, a
        cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air.
        In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your
        arm. </p><p id=\"eip-860\">When multiple forces act on an object, the forces
        combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total,
        or <span data-type=\"term\">net force</span>. An <span data-type=\"term\">external
        force</span> is a force that acts on an object inside of the system from outside
        of the system. This is different than an internal force, which acts between
        objects that are both within the system. The <span data-type=\"term\">net
        external force</span> combines these two definitions; it is the total combined
        external force. We go into more detail about net force, external force, and
        net external force in the coming sections. In mathematical terms, two forces
        acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or negative).
        By convention, the negative sign is assigned to movement to the left or downward.
        If two forces pushing in opposite directions are added together, the larger
        force will be somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite
        direction. It is important to be consistent with your chosen coordinate system
        within a problem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the downward
        direction for velocity, then distance, force and acceleration should also
        be designated as negative in the downward direction.</p><div data-type=\"note\"

        do not always get the right answers. In 1998, NASA, The National Aeronautics

        a $125 million dollar satellite designed to monitor the Martian atmosphere.
        It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance.
        The American scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches,
        pounds . . .) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard Metric SI
        units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned,
        the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up flying into the Martian atmosphere.  The
        probe disintegrated. It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA&#8217;s
        history. (<a href=\"/contents/9f74369f-1856-4a4e-be75-212989cb15bb@6#fs-idp30390784\"

        In this case, the Mars Climate Orbiter&#8217;s orbit needed to be calculated
        precisely because its machinery was only designed to withstand a certain amount
        of atmospheric pressure. The orbiter had to be close enough to the planet
        to take measurements and far enough away that it could remain structurally
        sound. One way to teach this concept would be to pick an orbital distance
        from Mars and have the students calculate the distance of the path and the
        height from the surface both in SI units and in English units. Ask why failure

        of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This gives us the opportunity
        to introduce a useful tool known as a <span data-type=\"term\">free-body diagram</span>.
        A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon (or free body)
        as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces)
        are shown and are represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These
        forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the
        body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body
        because they cancel each other out, as Newton&#8217;s third law will show.
        Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.\n</p><p

        shows the force of tension acting in the upward direction, opposite the force
        of gravity. These forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow
        pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing
        gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative
        magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Since forces are vectors, they add
        just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in
        <a href=\"#eip-idp140653750160320\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>,
        which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude.
        Since these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are
        perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.</p><p
        id=\"eip-287\">Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on
        something. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a
        magnet in the case of magnetic force or the gravitational pull of the earth
        in the case of gravitational force.</p><p id=\"eip-217\">In the next three
        sections on Newton&#8217;s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific
        types of forces&#8212;friction, the normal force, and the gravitational force.
        To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams
        to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.</p><div
