        id=\"eip-853\">Newton&#8217;s first law considered bodies at rest or bodies
        in motion at constant velocity. The other state of motion to consider is when
        an object is moving with a changing velocity, which means a change in either
        the speed and/or the direction of motion. This type of motion is addressed
        by <span data-type=\"term\">Newton&#8217;s second law of motion</span>, which
        states how force causes changes in motion. Newton&#8217;s second law of motion
        is used to calculate what happens in situations involving forces and motion,
        and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.
        Mathematically, the second law is most often written as <div data-type=\"equation\"

        F<sub>net</sub> (or &#8721;F) is the net external force, m is the mass of
        the system, and a is the acceleration. Note that F<sub>net</sub> and &#8721;F
        are the same because the net external force is the sum of all of the external
        forces acting on the system.</p><p id=\"eip-231\">First, what do we mean by
        &#8220;a change in motion&#8221;? A change in motion is simply a change in
        velocity: the velocity of an object can get bigger or smaller, its direction
        can change, or both. A change in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration
        has occurred. Newton&#8217;s first law says that only a nonzero net external
        force can cause a change in motion, so a net external force must cause an
        acceleration. Note that &#8220;acceleration&#8221; can refer to slowing down
        or to speeding up. Acceleration can also refer to a change in the direction
        of motion with no change in speed, because acceleration is the change in velocity
        divided by the time it takes for that change to occur, and velocity is defined
        by speed and direction.</p><p id=\"eip-187\">The equation MATH can be used

        id=\"eip-80\">From the equation F<sub>net</sub>=ma, we see that force is directly
        proportional to both mass and acceleration, which makes sense. To accelerate
        two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to
        be required to accelerate the more massive object. Likewise, for two objects
        of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a
        greater velocity.</p><p id=\"eip-873\">Now, let&#8217;s rearrange Newton&#8217;s
        second law to solve for acceleration. We get<div data-type=\"equation\" id=\"eip-idp42052864\">MATH</div></p><p
        id=\"eip-334\">In this form, it&#8217;s clear that acceleration is directly
        proportional to force, which we write as\n<div data-type=\"equation\" id=\"eip-503\">MATH</div></p><p
        id=\"eip-512\">where the symbol means &#8220;proportional to.&#8221; \n</p><p
        id=\"eip-981\">This proportionality states mathematically what we just said
        in words&#8212;acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force.
        When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable
        doubles, the other variable must double. Likewise, if one variable is reduced
        by half, the other variable must also be reduced by half. In general, when
        one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable will also be multiplied
        by the same number. It seems reasonable that the acceleration of a system
        should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external
        force acting on the system. An object experiences greater acceleration when
        acted on by a greater force.\n</p><p id=\"eip-840\">It is also clear from
        the equation MATH that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which
        we write as\n<div data-type=\"equation\" id=\"eip-16\">MATH</div></p><p id=\"eip-562\">Inversely
        proportional means that, if one variable is multiplied by a number, the other
        variable must be divided by the same number. Now, it also seems reasonable
        that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system.
        In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration
        produced by a given force. This is illustrated in Figure 04_03_basketball,
        which shows that a given net external force applied to a basketball produces
        a much greater acceleration than when applied to a car. </p><table id=\"eip-114\"

        id=\"fs-idp92945232\">Before putting Newton&#8217;s second law into action,
        it is important to consider units.\nThe equation   is used to define the units
        of force in terms of the three basic units of mass, length, and time (recall
        that acceleration has units of length divided by time squared). The SI unit
        of force is called the newton (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate
        a 1 kg system at the rate of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"
        display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>MATH</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml
        encoding=\"MathML-Content\"><mtext>MATH</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math>.
        That is, because, we have</p><div data-type=\"equation\" id=\"fs-idm47904816\"
        data-label=\"\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml

        id=\"fs-idm26521136\">One of the most important applications of Newton&#8217;s
        second law is to calculate weight (also known as the gravitational force),
        which is usually represented mathematically as W. When people talk about gravity,
        they don&#8217;t always realize that it is an acceleration. When an object
        is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton&#8217;s second
        law states that the net external force acting on an object is responsible
        for the acceleration of the object. If air resistance is negligible, the net
        external force on a falling object is only the gravitational force (i.e.,
        the weight of the object). </p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-idm118021760\">Weight can be
        represented by a vector because it has a direction. Down is defined as the
        direction in which gravity pulls, so weight is normally considered a downward
        force. By using Newton&#8217;s second law, we can figure out the equation
        for weight. </p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-idp13875040\">Consider an object with mass
        m falling toward Earth. It experiences only the force of gravity (i.e. the
        gravitational force or weight), which is represented by W. Newton&#8217;s
        second law states that <span data-type=\"term\">MATH</span> .Since the only
        force acting on the object is the gravitational force, we have <span data-type=\"term\">MATH</span>.
        We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is g, so we have
        <span data-type=\"term\">MATH</span>. Substituting these two expressions into
        Newton&#8217;s second law gives</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-idp8541664\">This is the
        equation for weight&#8212;the gravitational force on a mass m. On Earth, ,
        so the weight (disregarding for now the direction of the weight) of a 1.0
        kg object on Earth is</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-idp19230720\">Although most of the
        world uses newtons as the unit of force, in the United States the most familiar
        unit of force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb. </p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-idm44672656\">Recall
        that, although gravity acts downward, it can be assigned a positive or negative
        value, depending on the positive direction in your chosen coordinate system.
        Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight.
        When the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case,
        acceleration due to gravity becomes g =&#8722;9.8 m/s2.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-idm28725632\">When
        the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in freefall.
        In this case, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity.
        On the surface of Earth, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are
        never truly in freefall because there is always some upward force due to the
        air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force
        of air, which is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat).</p>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-idm27497904\">Gravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so
        that the weight of an object depends very slightly on its location on Earth.
        Weight varies dramatically away from Earth&#8217;s surface. On the Moon, for
        example, the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.67 m/s2. Because weight
        depends on the force of gravity, a 1.0 kg mass weighs 9.8 N on Earth and only
        about 1.7 N on the Moon.\nIt is important to remember that weight and mass
        are very different, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity
        of matter (how much &#8220;stuff&#8221;) in an object and does not vary, but
        weight is the gravitational force on an object and is proportional to the
        force of gravity. It is easy to confuse the two, because our experience is
        confined to Earth, and the weight of an object is essentially the same no
        matter where you are on Earth. Adding to the confusion, the terms mass and
        weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our
        medical records often show our &#8220;weight&#8221; in kilograms, but never
        in the correct units of newtons.</p>\n\n\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" id=\"fs-idm28711360\"

        Check Answer: As you push down on the table, part of your weight is applied
        to the table and the table exerts a matching force upward on you. This upward
        force exerted by the table acts in the direction opposite the force of your
        weight, therefore reducing the downward force on the scale. As a result your
        scale detects a smaller weight. (Note that the net external force on you is

        force is in the direction in which the person pushes. Also, the vertical forces
        must cancel if there is no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower

        pushing a mower; the mower&#8217;s speed must increase by 0.21 m/s every second,
        which is possible. The time during which mower accelerates would not be very

        involving gravity. The breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling.
        As our knowledge of nature has grown, the basic simplicity of its laws has
        become ever more evident.\n</p>\n<p id=\"eip-idp70825872\">\nNicolaus Copernicus
        (1473 &#8211; 1543) first had the idea that the planets circle the Sun about
        1514. It took him almost 20 years to work out the mathematical details for
        his model. He waited another 10 years or so to publish his work. It is thought
        he hesitated because he was afraid people would make fun of his theory. Actually,
        the reaction of many people was more one of fear and anger. Many people felt
        the Copernican model threatened their basic belief system. About 100 years
        later, the astronomer Galileo Galilei was arrested and put under house arrest
        for saying he thought the Earth traveled around the Sun. In all, it took almost
        300 years for everyone to admit that Nicolaus had been right all along.</p><p
