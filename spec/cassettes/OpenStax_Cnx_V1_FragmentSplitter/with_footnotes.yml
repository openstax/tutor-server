        Hickory: Andrew Jackson and the Battle of New Orleans</a> Narrative to paint
        a picture of the War of 1812.</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"fs-idm195863168\">The War
        of 1812 was begun when Congress declared war on Great Britain for repeatedly
        violating U.S. <span data-type=\"term\">sovereignty</span>. American ships
        were being stopped and their sailors were being impressed into British naval
        service. The war was primarily fought at sea and in Canadian and American
        territory around the Great Lakes.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm221259040\">In August
        1814, however, a British fleet sailed up the Chesapeake Bay and unloaded more
        than four thousand British redcoats and marines, who routed American troops
        in an embarrassing defeat at Bladensburg, Maryland. The British entered Washington,
        DC, and burned the U.S. Capitol and White House in retaliation for the American
        burning of York (modern-day Toronto) in Canada. Admiral Alexander Cochrane
        and his officers then decided to assault Baltimore and moved on the port city
        a few weeks later. Major General Samuel Smith of the Maryland <span data-type=\"term\">militia</span>
        prepared the city&#8217;s defenses for an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm230463744\">On
        September 12, 1814, in the predawn hours, 4,700 British troops disembarked
        at North Point on the Patapsco River for a fifteen-mile march on Baltimore
        led by General Robert Ross. The Royal Navy detachment, meanwhile, prepared
        to sail up the river, level Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, and contribute
        to the <span data-type=\"term\">bombardment</span> and burning of Baltimore.
        With a great deal of bluster, General Ross reportedly claimed he would &#8220;sup
        in Baltimore tonight, or in hell.&#8221;<sup data-type=\"footnote-number\"
        id=\"footnote-ref1\"><a data-type=\"footnote-link\" href=\"#footnote1\">1</a></sup>
        As he was urging his men forward against the first American lines, however,
        he was shot dead by an American rifleman.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm187897360\">Some
        five thousand American militia were deployed along a narrow part of the peninsula
        to block the British path. The two sides exchanged sharp artillery fire before
        the British attacked. In several bloody encounters, the British twice forced
        the Americans to retreat to their main battle line. The attack continued the
        next day, but the British suffered more than 350 casualties in their attacks
        on the fortified positions and were forced to withdraw. The infantry attack
        on Baltimore had failed.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm233819408\">Meanwhile, at 6:30
        in the morning of Tuesday, September 13, 1814, as the sun was rising over
        Baltimore Harbor, Major George Armistead and Captain Joseph Nicholson peered
        through their spyglasses at five British bomb ships swinging into position
        one and a half miles from star-shaped Fort McHenry. Armistead was the commander
        of the fort and Nicholson was the commander of the Baltimore Fencibles, a
        volunteer artillery company that joined in the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm218058048\">The
        one-thousand&#8211;man garrison of army regulars and volunteer troops was
        up and preparing the thirty-six guns for the defense of the fort and of Baltimore.
        They sweated because of the heat of the late summer day and their nerves,
        which were stretched to the limit.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm217034608\">Suddenly,
        the ship <em data-effect=\"italics\">Volcano</em> fired its massive mortars,
        lobbing two-hundred&#8211;pound explosive shells into the fort (<a href=\"#BRI_APUSH_05_03_FtMcHenry\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). The four other bomb ships joined
        in, as did the rest of the fleet. Houses in the vicinity began to shake as
        the ground rumbled. Inaccurate but terrifying screaming rockets were launched
        from the <em data-effect=\"italics\">Erebus,</em> adding to the deafening
        sound.</p>\n<figure id=\"BRI_APUSH_05_03_FtMcHenry\" class=\"full-width\"><figcaption>An
        1816 depiction of the British bombardment of Fort McHenry. One of the soldiers
        who was in the fort during the twenty-five&#8211;hour attack wrote, &#8220;We
        were like pigeons tied by the legs to be shot at.&#8221;</figcaption>\n<span
        data-type=\"media\" id=\"fs-idm227671504\" data-alt=\"A painting of ships
        off a coast shooting cannons at a fort, which has an American flag flying
        from it.\">\n<img src=\"/resources/85bdd4e2c8a6c6dabe99fce149dfa232d921c05e/BRI_APUSH_05_03_FtMcHenry.jpg\"
        data-media-type=\"image/jpeg\" alt=\"A painting of ships off a coast shooting
        cannons at a fort, which has an American flag flying from it.\"/>\n</span>\n\n</figure>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idm224328880\">The Americans were not shaken for long. Major Armistead
        mounted a parapet and ordered the soldiers to return fire. Several cannonballs
        scored direct hits on British ships. The Americans gave a celebratory cheer
        when the British withdrew because of the unexpected severity of their returned
        fire.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm185065920\">But the British had simply moved out
        of range of the American guns, and their bomb ships could still hit the fort.
        Armistead thought this was a distressing disadvantage for the men in Fort
        McHenry. Still, they kept at their posts until he ordered them to take cover
        in a moat because of the rain of shells.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm223600384\">The
        Americans were frustrated that they were being bombarded and suffering casualties
        but were unable to return fire. An escaped slave in the army had his leg blown
        off, and another soldier was killed by a direct hit while shaking uncontrollably
        from shell shock. Everyone was terrified and waiting to be blown to smithereens
        when a shell crashed through the roof of the magazine where three hundred
        barrels of gunpowder were stored, but miraculously the gunpowder did not explode.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-idm221969440\">In the early afternoon, the sun disappeared behind
        a large bank of clouds. Suddenly, a deluge of rain from a <span data-type=\"term\">nor&#8217;easter</span>
        pummeled both sides, ruining gunpowder and fuses and giving the Americans
        in the fort a brief respite. The British compensated by moving the fleet closer
        to fire broadsides from several other warships. The Americans, who had lowered
        their flag and raised a storm flag, because of the rain, quickly fired their
        own guns. The <em data-effect=\"italics\">Volcano</em> immediately suffered
        five hits that caused casualties and started to withdraw. The <em data-effect=\"italics\">Devastation</em>
        suffered a staggering blow to her port bow that caused her to take on water.
        As the British fleet again retreated out of range, the <em data-effect=\"italics\">Erebus</em>
        was damaged and had to be towed back. However, the British onslaught from
        the bomb ships continued even more furiously.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm185161568\">As
        darkness arrived, Admiral Cochrane had to admit things were not going according
        to plan. He had boasted to his men that the fleet would reduce the walls of
        the fort and force a surrender in less than two hours, leaving Baltimore vulnerable
        to a coordinated land-sea assault. But the walls stood firm, and the inhabitants
        of the fort clearly had no intention of surrendering.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm185011536\">The
        shelling continued through the night, and at approximately 2 a.m., the earth
        shuddered from a concerted bombardment of the fort as the fleet opened up
        with a terrible roar. The barrage was actually cover for a raid, with troops
        from several barges preparing to slip past the fort and outflank the American
        infantry. The barges were sighted, however, and the fort aimed its fire at
        them, scoring direct hits and sinking a couple as the others retreated back
        to the fleet.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm227586176\">The British fleet and Fort McHenry
        exchanged intermittent fire as dawn approached, and the exhausted men on both
        sides struggled to stay awake. The British had failed to destroy the fort,
        however, and finally sailed off. The American defenders for their part were
        relieved to have survived the British onslaught and were exultant, despite
        their fatigue.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm196061824\">The rising sun was hidden for
        a while in a cloudy, misty morning. Francis Scott Key was observing from a
        ship in the harbor when rays of sunlight illuminated the storm flag waving
        in a slight breeze. A morning shot pierced the air, and the immense 30-by-42-foot
        star-spangled banner was raised as the men stood at attention. Key pulled
        a letter from his pocket and started to jot words and notes on it for a song
        that came to mind. &#8220;O say can you see by the dawn&#8217;s early light
        . . .&#8221; it began, and it ended with &#8220;O&#8217;er the land of the
        free, and the home of the brave.&#8221; The song later became the United States&#8217;
        national anthem in 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm217270368\">The American forces
        had redeemed themselves at Baltimore after the national humiliation in Washington,
        DC. Only a few months later, on December 24, U.S. commissioners including
        John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Albert Gallatin signed the Treaty of Ghent,
        officially ending the War of 1812 (<a href=\"#BRI_APUSH_05_03_TreatGhent\"
