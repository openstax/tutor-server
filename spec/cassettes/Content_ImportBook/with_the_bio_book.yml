        id=\"fs-id1167065801289\">Viewed from space, Earth offers no clues about the
        diversity of life it harbors. The first forms of life on Earth are thought
        be microorganisms that existed for billions of years in the ocean before plants
        and animals appeared. The mammals, birds, and flowers that we see in modern
        times are mostly &#8220;recent&#8221; species, originating 130 to 200 million
        years ago. In fact, only in the last 200,000 years have humans started looking
        like we do today.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066095971\">Organisms evolve in
        response to each other. One of the best examples is disease causing organisms,
        which have to adapt to overcome the defenses of the organisms they infect.
        One such organism that has evolved to specialize in infection in humans is
        <em data-effect=\"italics\">Plasmodium</em>, the organism that causes malaria.
        Biologists use the process of science to learn about the world and the organisms
        living in it. For example, people have suspected for quite some time that
        people with blood type O are less likely to die from severe malaria. Now,
        a team of scientists have been able to explain why. By examining data from
        several experiments, and by using both inductive and deductive reasoning,
        the scientists concluded that A and B type blood reacts with a protein excreted
        by <em data-effect=\"italics\">Plasmodium</em>. This reaction causes severe
        illness. However, type O blood does not react with the protein. You can <a
        href=\"http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32plasmodium\">read more</a> about the
        response of type A and B blood groups to infection by <em data-effect=\"italics\">Plasmodium</em>.\n\n</p><div
        data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id1167065722529\" class=\"note
        os-teacher\" data-label=\"Teacher Support\">\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065977234\">Introduce
        the concept of unity and diversity of life. There are so many varieties of
        organisms and, yet, the cell is the basic unit of life. The fundamental structures
        and life processes of cells are similar; but, how these cells are utilized
        in different organisms is hugely varied and reflects adaptation of the organism
        to its environment. The many differences between species accumulated over
        long periods of time. Students are often unfamiliar with geological time scales.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1167066145469\">The malaria example was chosen because malaria has
        been one of the most pervasive and widespread human disease. Therefore, through
        much of human history, malaria has been a strong force of natural selection
        on humans. Human genetics has evolved in response to this selection pressure,
        as with the example of resistance among O-type blood groups described in the
        introduction. Further examples can also be found <a href=\"http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32coevmalaria\"

        is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one
        another and with their environment. The process of science attempts to describe
        and understand the nature of the universe by rational means. Science has many
        fields; those fields related to the physical world, including biology, are
        considered natural sciences. All of the natural sciences follow the laws of
        chemistry and physics. For example, when studying biology, you must remember
        living organisms obey the laws of thermodynamics while using free energy and
        matter from the environment to carry out life processes that are explored
        in later chapters, such as metabolism and reproduction.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065757854\">Two
        types of logical reasoning are used in science: inductive reasoning and deductive
        reasoning. <span data-type=\"term\">Inductive reasoning</span> uses particular
        results to produce general scientific principles. <span data-type=\"term\">Deductive
        reasoning</span> uses logical thinking to predict results by applying scientific
        principles or practices. The scientific method is a step-by-step process that
        consists of: making observations, defining a problem, posing hypotheses, testing
        these hypotheses by designing and conducting investigations, and drawing conclusions
        from data and results. Scientists then communicate their results to the scientific
        community. Scientific theories are subject to revision as new information
        is collected.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167064909726\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">The

        sciences; each discipline is in its own sphere. Give as an example, bioinformatics
        which uses organism biology, chemistry, and physics to label DNA with light
        emitting reporter molecules (Next Generation sequencing). These molecules
        can then be scanned by light-sensing machinery, allowing huge amounts of information
        to be gathered on their DNA. Bring to their attention the fact that the analysis

        is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and
        their environments. This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology
        is vast. Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic
        view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet (<a href=\"#fs-id1167065707918\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). Listening to the daily news,
        you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology are discussed every day.
        For example, recent news topics include <em data-effect=\"italics\">Escherichia
        coli</em> (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>)
        outbreaks in spinach and <em data-effect=\"italics\">Salmonella</em> contamination
        in peanut butter. <!--Other subjects include efforts toward finding a cure
        for AIDS, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and cancer.--> On a global scale, many
        researchers are committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental
        issues, and reduce the effects of climate change. All of these diverse endeavors
        are related to different facets of the discipline of biology.</p><figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_02\"><figcaption><em

        data-type=\"title\">The Process of Science</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id2739621\">Biology
        is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology
        share with other scientific disciplines? <span data-type=\"term\">Science</span>
        (from the Latin <em data-effect=\"italics\">scientia</em>, meaning &#8220;knowledge&#8221;)
        can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of
        general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method.
        It becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific
        method plays a major role in science. The <span data-type=\"term\">scientific
        method</span> is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments
        and careful observation.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1787324\">The steps of the scientific
        method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects
        of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments.
        A <span data-type=\"term\">hypothesis</span> is a suggested explanation for
        an event, which can be tested. Although using the scientific method is inherent
        to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. This is because
        it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as
        physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like archaeology,
        psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as
        it becomes more difficult to repeat experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2186987\">These
        areas of study are still sciences, however. Consider archeology&#8212;even
        though one cannot perform repeatable experiments, hypotheses may still be
        supported. For instance, an archeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture
        existed based on finding a piece of pottery. Further hypotheses could be made
        about various characteristics of this culture, and these hypotheses may be
        found to be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from
        other findings. A hypothesis may become a verified theory. A <span data-type=\"term\">theory</span>
        is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. Science
        may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature
        of the universe.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1167066094905\"

        of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about how
        the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or, maybe all of the

        sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (<a href=\"#fs-id1167065891178\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). However, those fields of science

        is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences
        include, however. For some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology,
        chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural
        sciences into <span data-type=\"term\">life sciences</span>, which study living
        things and include biology, and <span data-type=\"term\">physical sciences</span>,
        which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and
        chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both
        life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. Natural sciences are
        sometimes referred to as &#8220;hard science&#8221; because they rely on the
        use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior
        are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive investigations and
        findings.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1780952\">Not surprisingly, the natural science
        of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. Cell biologists study cell
        structure and function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the
        structure of an entire organism. Those biologists studying physiology, however,
        focus on the internal functioning of an organism. Some areas of biology focus
        on only particular types of living things. For example, botanists explore
        plants, while zoologists specialize in animals.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section

        ost-get-exercise\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Scientific Reasoning</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1422041\">One
        thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal &#8220;to know.&#8221;
        Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the development of science.
        Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. To do this,
        they use two methods of logical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive
        reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1727981\">Inductive reasoning is a form of logical
        thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion.
        This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist
        such as a biologist makes observations and records them. These data can be
        qualitative or quantitative, and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings,
        pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer
        conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating
        generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large
        amount of data. Brain studies provide an example. In this type of research,
        many live brains are observed while people are doing a specific activity,
        such as viewing images of food. The part of the brain that &#8220;lights up&#8221;
        during this activity is then predicted to be the part controlling the response
        to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. The &#8220;lighting
        up&#8221; of the various areas of the brain is caused by excess absorption
        of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain. The resultant
        increase in radioactivity is observed by a scanner. Then, researchers can
        stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2979121\">Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic
        used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reason, the pattern of thinking
        moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive
        reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law
        to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can
        extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as
        the general principles are valid. Studies in climate change can illustrate
        this type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate
        becomes warmer in a particular region, then the distribution of plants and
        animals should change. These predictions have been made and tested, and many
        such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for
        agriculture, with change based on temperature averages.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1786661\">Both
        types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific
        study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based science. <span data-type=\"term\">Descriptive
        (or discovery) science</span>, which is usually inductive, aims to observe,
        explore, and discover, while <span data-type=\"term\">hypothesis-based science</span>,
        which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and
        a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these
        two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine
        both approaches. The fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how
        easily observation can lead to specific questions. For example, a gentleman
        in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his
        dog&#8217;s fur had a tiny hook structure. On closer inspection, he discovered
        that the burrs&#8217; gripping device was more reliable than a zipper. He
        eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener <!--popularly
        known today as Velcro-->often used on lace-less sneakers and athletic braces.
        Descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n<section

        id=\"fs-id1870503\">Biologists study the living world by posing questions
        about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach is common to other
        sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific
        method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England&#8217;s
        Sir Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626) (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_04\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>),
        who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method
        is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost all fields
        of study as a logical, rational problem-solving method.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch01_01_04\"><figcaption>Sir

        scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to
        be solved) that leads to a question. Let&#8217;s think about a simple problem
        that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the
        problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers
        that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes
        a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: &#8220;Why
        is the classroom so warm?&#8221;</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1167065975433\"
        class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch01-s01-lo2 ost-get-exercise\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Proposing
        a Hypothesis</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1812636\">Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested
        explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may
        be proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, &#8220;The classroom is
        warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.&#8221; But there could
        be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be
        proposed. A second hypothesis might be, &#8220;The classroom is warm because
        there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1966007\">Once a hypothesis has been selected, the student can make
        a prediction. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has
        the format &#8220;If . . . then . . . .&#8221; For example, the prediction
        for the first hypothesis might be, &#8220;<em data-effect=\"italics\">If</em>
        the student turns on the air conditioning, <em data-effect=\"italics\">then</em>
        the classroom will no longer be too warm.&#8221;</p>\n</section>\n<section
        data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1167065680631\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch01-s01-lo02
        ost-get-exercise\"><h2 data-type=\"title\">Testing a Hypothesis</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1428118\">A
        valid hypothesis must be testable. It should also be <span data-type=\"term\">falsifiable</span>,
        meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results. Importantly, science
        does not claim to &#8220;prove&#8221; anything because scientific understandings
        are always subject to modification with further information. This step&#8212;openness
        to disproving ideas&#8212;is what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences.
        The presence of the supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable.
        To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed
        to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. Each experiment will have one
        or more variables and one or more controls. A <span data-type=\"term\">variable</span>
        is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment.
        The <span data-type=\"term\">control group</span> contains every feature of
        the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized
        about. Therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the
        control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation,
        rather than some outside factor. Look for the variables and controls in the
        examples that follow. To test the first hypothesis, the student would find
        out if the air conditioning is on. If the air conditioning is turned on but
        does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should
        be rejected. To test the second hypothesis, the student could check if the
        lights in the classroom are functional. If so, there is no power failure and
        this hypothesis should be rejected. Each hypothesis should be tested by carrying
        out appropriate experiments. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not
        determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates
        one hypothesis that is not valid (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_05\" class=\"has-default-text\">see
        this figure</a>). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent
        with experimental data are rejected.</p><p id=\"fs-id2000920\">While this
        &#8220;warm classroom&#8221; example is based on observational results, other
        hypotheses and experiments might have clearer controls. For instance, a student
        might attend class on Monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating
        on the lecture. One observation to explain this occurrence might be, &#8220;When
        I eat breakfast before class, I am better able to pay attention.&#8221; The
        student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1473946\">In hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted
        from a general premise. This type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning:
        deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. But the reverse of
        the process is also possible: sometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion
        from a number of specific observations. This type of reasoning is called inductive
        reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general. Inductive and
        deductive reasoning are often used in tandem to advance scientific knowledge
        (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_01_06\" class=\"has-default-text\">see this figure</a>)</p>\n</section>\n\n<div

        id=\"fs-id1386450\">The scientific method may seem too rigid and structured.
        It is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often follow this
        sequence, there is flexibility. Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions
        that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new
        scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in
        a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make
        generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientific reasoning
        is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests. Notice, too, that
        the scientific method can be applied to solving problems that aren&#8217;t
        necessarily scientific in nature.</p>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167065737612\"

        Types of Science: Basic Science and Applied Science</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id1983427\">The
        scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the
        value of different types of science. Is it valuable to pursue science for
        the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have
        worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our
        lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science:
        basic science and applied science.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1980540\"><span data-type=\"term\">Basic
        science</span> or &#8220;pure&#8221; science seeks to expand knowledge regardless
        of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not focused on developing
        a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate
        goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge&#8217;s sake, though this
        does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2164078\">In contrast, <span data-type=\"term\">applied science</span>
        or &#8220;technology,&#8221; aims to use science to solve real-world problems,
        making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for
        a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster (<a
        href=\"#fs-id1167066104676\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.</p>\n\n<figure

        Hurricane Ike struck the Gulf Coast in 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

        id=\"fs-id3662284\">Some individuals may perceive applied science as &#8220;useful&#8221;
        and basic science as &#8220;useless.&#8221; A question these people might
        pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, &#8220;What
        for?&#8221; A careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that
        basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value.
        Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before
        an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results
        generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to
        move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems.
        Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand
        immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help
        of the wide knowledge foundation generated through basic science.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1803917\">One example of how basic and applied science can work
        together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA structure
        led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication.
        Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they
        provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, DNA makes
        new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides. Understanding the mechanisms
        of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that
        are now used to identify genetic diseases<!--, pinpoint individuals who were
        at a crime scene, and determine paternity.--> Without basic science, it is
        unlikely that applied science would exist.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2690084\">Another
        example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome
        Project, a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to
        determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location of each
        gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual&#8217;s complete
        collection of genes is his or her genome.) Other less complex organisms have
        also been studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding
        of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (<a href=\"#fs-id1167065800110\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>) relied on basic research carried
        out with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important
        end goal eventually became using the data for applied research, seeking cures
        and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases.</p>\n<figure id=\"fs-id1167065800110\"

        planned, it is important to note that some discoveries are made by <span data-type=\"term\">serendipity</span>,
        that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. Penicillin
        was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri
        dish of <em data-effect=\"italics\">Staphylococcus</em> bacteria open. An
        unwanted mold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out
        to be <em data-effect=\"italics\">Penicillium</em>, and a new antibiotic was
        discovered. Even in the highly organized world of science, luck&#8212;when
        combined with an observant, curious mind&#8212;can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.</p>\n</section>\n<section

        id=\"fs-id3019610\">Whether scientific research is basic science or applied
        science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers
        to expand and build upon their discoveries. Collaboration with other scientists&#8212;when
        planning, conducting, and analyzing results&#8212;are all important for scientific
        research. For this reason, important aspects of a scientist&#8217;s work are
        communicating with peers and disseminating results to peers. Scientists can
        share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but
        this approach can reach only the select few who are present. Instead, most
        scientists present their results in peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published
        in scientific journals. <span data-type=\"term\">Peer-reviewed manuscripts</span>
        are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientist&#8217;s colleagues,
        or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the
        same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist&#8217;s work is
        suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that
        the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original,
        significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for
        research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their
        work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or
        different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must
        be consistent with the findings of other scientists.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2979084\">A
        scientific paper is very different from creative writing. Although creativity
        is required to design experiments, there are fixed guidelines when it comes
        to presenting scientific results. First, scientific writing must be brief,
        concise, and accurate. A scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed
        enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2954730\">The
        scientific paper consists of several specific sections&#8212;introduction,
        materials and methods, results, and discussion. This structure is sometimes
        called the &#8220;IMRaD&#8221; format. There are usually acknowledgment and
        reference sections as well as an <span data-type=\"term\">abstract</span>
        (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. There might be additional
        sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published;
        for example, some review papers require an outline.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1292278\">The
        <span data-type=\"term\">introduction</span> starts with brief, but broad,
        background information about what is known in the field. A good introduction
        also gives the rationale of the work; it justifies the work carried out and
        also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where the hypothesis or research
        question driving the research will be presented. The introduction refers to
        the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following
        the style of the journal. Using the work or ideas of others without proper
        citation is considered <span data-type=\"term\">plagiarism</span>.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2279649\">The <span data-type=\"term\">materials and methods</span>
        section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used,
        and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data. The
        description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat
        the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose.
        This section will also include information on how measurements were made and
        what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to examine raw
        data. Although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description
        of the experiments, it does not discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1790931\">Some
        journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it
        is more common to combine both. If the journal does not allow the combination
        of both sections, the <span data-type=\"term\">results</span> section simply
        narrates the findings without any further interpretation. The results are
        presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should
        be presented. In the <span data-type=\"term\">discussion</span> section, the
        researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related,
        and attempt to explain the observations. It is indispensable to conduct an
        extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously
        published scientific research. Therefore, proper citations are included in
        this section as well.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2967146\">Finally, the <span data-type=\"term\">conclusion</span>
        section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. While the
        scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions
        that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions. Therefore,
        a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others
        to continue and expand on the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1318474\"><span
        data-type=\"term\">Review articles</span> do not follow the IMRAD format because
        they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature; instead,
        they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature
        and typically include extensive reference sections.</p>\n</section>\n<section

        data-type=\"title\">Section Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id2261646\">Biology is
        the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one
        another and their environments. Science attempts to describe and understand
        the nature of the universe in whole or in part by rational means. Science
        has many fields; those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena
        are considered natural sciences.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1836512\">Science can be
        basic or applied. The main goal of basic science is to expand knowledge without
        any expectation of short-term practical application of that knowledge. The
        primary goal of applied research, however, is to solve practical problems.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2909561\">Two types of logical reasoning are used in science. Inductive
        reasoning uses particular results to produce general scientific principles.
        Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts results by
        applying general principles. The common thread throughout scientific research
        is the use of the scientific method, a step-based process that consists of
        making observations, defining a problem, posing hypotheses, testing these
        hypotheses, and drawing one or more conclusions. The testing uses proper controls.
        Scientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific papers published
        in scientific journals. A scientific research paper consists of several well-defined
        sections: introduction, materials and methods, results, and, finally, a concluding
        discussion. Review papers summarize the research done in a particular field
        over a period of time.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167065849184\"

        for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</h1><p id=\"fs-id1167066831692\">The AP<sup>&#174;</sup>
        Biology curriculum is organized around four major themes called the Big Ideas
        that apply to all levels of biological organization&#8212;from molecules and
        cells to populations and ecosystems. Each Big Idea identifies key concepts
        called Enduring Understandings, and Essential Knowledges, along with supporting
        examples. Simple descriptions define the focus of each Big Idea: Big Idea
        1, Evolution; Big Idea 2, Energy and Homeostasis; Big Idea 3, Information
        and Communication; and Big Idea 4, Systems and Interactions. Evolution explains
        both the unity and diversity of life, Big Idea 1, and all organisms require
        energy and molecules to carry out life functions, such as growth and reproduction,
        Big Idea 2. Living systems also store, transmit, and respond to information,
        from DNA sequences to nerve impulses and behaviors, Big Idea 3. All biological
        systems interact, and these interactions result in emergent properties and
        characteristics unique to life, Big Idea 4.</p><p id=\"fs-id1167066856741\">The
        redesigned AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Biology course also emphasizes the investigative
        practices that students should master. Scientific inquiry usually uses a series
        of steps to gain new knowledge. The scientific method begins with an observation
        and follows with a hypothesis to explain the observation; then experiments
        are conducted to test the hypothesis, gather results, and draw conclusions
        from data. The AP<sup>&#174;</sup> program has identified seven major categories
        of Science Practices, which can be described by short phrases: using representations
        and models to communicate information and solve problems; using mathematics
        appropriately; engaging in questioning; planning and implementing data collection
        strategies; analyzing and evaluating data; justifying scientific explanations;
        and connecting concepts. A Learning Objective merges content with one or more
        of the seven Science Practices.</p><p id=\"fs-id1167066961369\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">The
        information presented and the examples highlighted in this section support
        concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 of the AP<sup>&#174;</sup>
        Biology Curriculum. The Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework
        provide a transparent foundation for the AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Biology course,
        an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP<sup>&#174;</sup>
        Exam questions. A Learning Objective merges required content with one or more
        of the seven Science Practices.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066837921\" class=\"ost-reading-discard

        is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound
        like a silly question with an obvious response, but it is not always easy
        to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses,
        which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others.
        It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases,
        and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define
        life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly,
        some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life;
        since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists
        are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2248548\">From
        its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are
        the shared properties that make something &#8220;alive&#8221;? And once we
        know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization
        in its structure? And, finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of
        life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better
        understand them? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue
        to seek answers to these and other questions.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"1\"

        are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells.
        Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex: inside each
        cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and other
        cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (<a href=\"#fs-id1167067216956\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>), similar cells form tissues. Tissues,

        Organelles are small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles
        include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions:
        mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green
        plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things

        requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of
        cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive
        mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need
        to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular.
        Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <span data-type=\"term\">Prokaryotes</span>
        are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei;
        in contrast, the cells of <span data-type=\"term\">eukaryotes</span> do have

        larger organisms, cells combine to make <span data-type=\"term\">tissues</span>,
        which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions.
        <span data-type=\"term\">Organs</span> are collections of tissues grouped
        together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals
        but also in plants. An <span data-type=\"term\">organ system</span> is a higher
        level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals
        have many organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood
        through the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the
        heart and blood vessels. <span data-type=\"term\">Organisms</span> are individual
        living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled
        prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and
        are typically referred to as microorganisms.</p>\n<p id=\"eip-622\">All the
        individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called
        a <span data-type=\"term\">population</span>. For example, a forest may include
        many pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of pine
        trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific
        area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of
        flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A <span data-type=\"term\">community</span>
        is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all
        of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the
        forest&#8217;s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An <span data-type=\"term\">ecosystem</span>
        consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic,
        non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain
        water. At the highest level of organization (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066971938\"
        class=\"has-default-text\">see this figure</a>), the <span data-type=\"term\">biosphere</span>
        is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on
        earth. It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.</p>\n\n<div

        science, has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of
        life on earth. The source of this diversity is <span data-type=\"term\">evolution</span>,
        the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species.
        Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything
        from the microscopic world to ecosystems.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2199492\">The
        evolution of various life forms on Earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic
        tree (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066867652\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        A <span data-type=\"term\">phylogenetic tree</span> is a diagram showing the
        evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities
        and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree
        is composed of nodes and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors
        and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor
        is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch
        is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"fs-id1167066867652\"

        Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree</span>In the past, biologists grouped living
        organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria.
        The organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed
        to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by
        modern systematics. The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese
        in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along
        three lineages, now called domains&#8212;Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The
        first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed
        nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes
        unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding
        bacteria). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new
        taxonomic tree (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066867652\" class=\"has-default-text\">see
        this figure</a>). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under
        extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese
        used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).</p>\n    <p
        id=\"fs-id2956594\">Woese&#8217;s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing
        of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism,
        and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged
        throughout evolution). Woese&#8217;s approach was revolutionary because comparisons
        of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes
        that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity
        and genetic variability (<a href=\"#fig-ch01_02_09\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        The comparison of homologous DNA and RNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive
        device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified
        the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.</p><figure

        possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists
        on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment
        of DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists

        communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere. The great diversity of life today
        evolved from less-diverse ancestral organisms over billions of years. A diagram
        called a phylogenetic tree can be used to show evolutionary relationships
        among organisms.</p><p id=\"fs-id1467930\">Biology is very broad and includes
        many branches and subdisciplines. Examples include molecular biology, microbiology,
        neurobiology, zoology, and botany, among others.</p>\n</section>\n<section

        provides the body with the nutrients it needs to survive. Many of these critical
        nutrients are biological macromolecules, or large molecules, necessary for
        and built by living things. For example, the amino acids found in protein
        are needed to build healthy bone and muscle. The body uses fat molecules to
        build new cells, store energy, and for proper digestion. Carbohydrates are
        the primary source of the body&#8217;s energy. Nucleic acids contain genetic
        information.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066121734\">While all living things, including
        humans, need macromolecules in their daily diet, an imbalance of any one of
        them can lead to health problems. For example, eating too much fat can lead
        to cardiovascular problems, and too much protein can lead to problems with
        the kidneys. Some people think that removing whole grains, such as wheat,
        from one&#8217;s diet can be beneficial. However, scientists have found that
        to not be true for the majority of people. In fact, just the opposite may
        be true, because whole wheat contains more dietary fiber than other types
        of grains. The full research review can be found <a href=\"http://openstaxcollege.org/l/32wholegrain\">here</a>.</p><div

        organisms need food to survive as it contains critical nutrients in the form
        of biological macromolecules. These large molecules are composed mainly of
        six elements&#151;sulfur, phosphorus, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen
        (SPONCH)&#151;in different quantities and arrangements. Complex polymers are
        built from combinations of smaller monomers by dehydration synthesis, a chemical
        reaction in which a molecule of water is removed between two linking monomers.
        (Think of a train: each boxcar, including the caboose, represents a monomer,
        and the entire train is a polymer.) During digestion, polymers can be broken
        down by hydrolysis, or the addition of water. Both dehydration and hydrolysis
        reactions in cells are catalyzed by specific enzymes. Dehydration reactions
        typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation, whereas
        hydrolysis reactions typically release energy that can be used to power cellular
        processes. The four categories of macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids,
        proteins, and nucleic acids.  Evidence supports scientists&#146; claim that
        the organic precursors of these biological molecules were present on primitive
        Earth.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066105108\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">Information

        macromolecules</span> are large molecules, necessary for life, that are built
        from smaller organic molecules. There are four major classes of biological
        macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids); each
        is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions. Combined,
        these molecules make up the majority of a cell&#8217;s dry mass (recall that
        water makes up the majority of its complete mass). Biological macromolecules
        are organic, meaning they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen,
        oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1384510\">Most
        macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called <span
        data-type=\"term\">monomers</span>. The monomers combine with each other using
        covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as <span data-type=\"term\">polymers</span>.
        In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of
        reaction is known as <span data-type=\"term\">dehydration synthesis</span>,
        which means &#8220;to put together while losing water.&#8221;</p>\n<figure

        complex macromolecules could be created in the absence of life. The resulting
        molecules floated around in the atmosphere and eventually fell into the early
        oceans, then probably became incorporated into primitive cells.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p

        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>), the hydrogen of one monomer combines
        with the hydroxyl group of another monomer, releasing a molecule of water.
        At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds. As
        additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer.
        Different types of monomers can combine in many configurations, giving rise
        to a diverse group of macromolecules. Even one kind of monomer can combine
        in a variety of ways to form several different polymers: for example, glucose
        monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen, and cellulose.</p></section>\n\n<section

        most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for
        its class. For example, in our bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down,
        into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system. This
        allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine. Each macromolecule
        is broken down by a specific enzyme. For instance, carbohydrates are broken
        down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase. Proteins are broken down by
        the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid. Lipids are broken
        down by lipases. Breakdown of these macromolecules provides energy for cellular

        apparatus like the one shown in <a href=\"#figure_03_01_03\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>
        to model early conditions on earth. They wanted to test if organic molecules
        could form from inorganic precursors believed to exist very early in Earth&#8217;s
        history. They used boiling water to mimic early Earth&#8217;s oceans. Steam
        from the &#8220;ocean&#8221; combined with methane, ammonia, and hydrogen
        gases from the early Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and was exposed to electrical
        sparks to act as lightning. As the gas mixture cooled and condensed, it was
        found to contain organic compounds, such as amino acids and nucleotides. According
        to the abiogenesis theory, these organic molecules came together to form the
        earliest form of life about 3.5 billion years ago. (credit: Yassine Mrabet)</p>\n<figure

        osmotic conditions. A monomer joins with another monomer with the release
        of a water molecule, leading to the formation of a covalent bond. These types
        of reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions. When polymers
        are broken down into smaller units (monomers), a molecule of water is used
        for each bond broken by these reactions; such reactions are known as hydrolysis
        reactions. Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all macromolecules,
        but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class. Dehydration
        reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation,
        while hydrolysis reactions typically release energy by breaking bonds.</p></section>\n\n\n\n<section

        and oxygen in the ratio CH<sub>2</sub>O or carbon hydrated with water, carbohydrates
        are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending
        on the number of monomers in the macromolecule. Monosaccharides are linked
        by glycosidic bonds that form as a result of dehydration synthesis. Glucose,
        galactose, and fructose are common isomeric monosaccharides, whereas sucrose
        or table sugar is a disaccharide. Examples of polysaccharides include cellulose
        and starch in plants and glycogen in animals. Although storing glucose in
        the form of polymers like starch or glycogen makes it less accessible for
        metabolism, this prevents it from leaking out of cells or creating a high
        osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell. Insects
        have a hard outer skeleton made of chitin, a unique nitrogen-containing polysaccharide.</p>\n<p

        one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat. To lose
        weight, some individuals adhere to &#8220;low-carb&#8221; diets. Athletes,
        in contrast, often &#8220;carb-load&#8221; before important competitions to
        ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates
        are, in fact, an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables
        are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to
        the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar that is a component
        of <span data-type=\"term\">starch</span> and an ingredient in many staple
        foods. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans, animals,
        and plants.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1262009\"><span data-type=\"term\">Carbohydrates</span>
        can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<em data-effect=\"italics\"><sub>n</sub></em>,
        where n is the number of carbons in the molecule. In other words, the ratio
        of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. This formula
        also explains the origin of the term &#8220;carbohydrate&#8221;: the components
        are carbon (&#8220;carbo&#8221;) and the components of water (hence, &#8220;hydrate&#8221;).
        Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides,
        and polysaccharides.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1462931\" class=\"ost-get-exercise\"><h2

        (mono- = &#8220;one&#8221;; sacchar- = &#8220;sweet&#8221;) are simple sugars,
        the most common of which is glucose. In monosaccharides, the number of carbons
        usually ranges from three to seven. Most monosaccharide names end with the
        suffix -ose. If the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with
        the structure R-CHO), it is known as an aldose, and if it has a ketone group
        (the functional group with the structure RC(=O)R''), it is known as a ketose.
        Depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they also may be known as
        trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and or hexoses (six carbons).

        is known as a <span data-type=\"term\">polysaccharide</span> (poly- = &#8220;many&#8221;).
        The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types
        of monosaccharides. The molecular weight may be 100,000 daltons or more depending
        on the number of monomers joined. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin
        are primary examples of polysaccharides.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1712546\">Starch
        is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose
        and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize
        glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plant&#8217;s immediate energy
        needs, is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds.
        The starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and
        can also act as a source of food for humans and animals. The starch that is
        consumed by humans is broken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into
        smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. The cells can then absorb
        the glucose.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1707972\">Starch is made up of glucose monomers
        that are joined by <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#945;</em> 1-4 or <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#945;</em>
        1-6 glycosidic bonds. The numbers 1-4 and 1-6 refer to the carbon number of
        the two residues that have joined to form the bond. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig-ch03_02_06\"

        include more than just table sugar. All have the basic formula CH<sub>2</sub>O.  The
        ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is always the same. The number of carbons
        determines the category of sugar. Biological sugars are usually pentoses (5
        carbon or C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) or hexoses (6 carbon or
        C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).</li>\n<li>Monosaccharides are the
        building blocks of all sugars. If two are combined, they are disaccharides;
        if more than two are combined, they make up a large molecule called a polysaccharide.  The
        type of linkage between the monomers determines whether animals can digest
        them. If the oxygen linking the monomers is oriented down relative to both
        adjacent carbons, it is called an alpha bond and can be digested. If the oxygen
        atom orients upward relative to one carbon and downward relative to the next,
        it is called a beta bond and is not able to be digested by animal digestive
        enzymes.</li>\n<li>In the United States, people consume large quantities of
        carbohydrates, often in the form of sugars. Carbohydrates provide an immediate
        source of energy when broken down. They are also involved in the metabolism

        every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over, and the monomers
        are packed tightly as extended long chains. This gives cellulose its rigidity
        and high tensile strength&#8212;which is so important to plant cells. While
        the <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#946;</em> 1-4 linkage cannot be broken down
        by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, koalas, buffalos, and
        horses are able, with the help of the specialized flora in their stomach,
        to digest plant material that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source.
        In these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen
        (part of the digestive system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase.
        The appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest cellulose,
        giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases
        can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy
        source by the animal. Termites are also able to break down cellulose because
        of the presence of other organisms in their bodies that secrete cellulases.</p><p

        such as diabetes and heart disease are becoming more prevalent because of
        obesity. This is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are increasingly
        sought after for advice. Registered dietitians help plan nutrition programs
        for individuals in various settings. They often work with patients in health
        care facilities, designing nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases.
        For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood
        sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians
        may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1396080\">To
        become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor&#8217;s
        degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a related field. In addition,
        registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass
        a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition,
        chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians
        must become experts in the chemistry and physiology (biological functions)
        of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).</p>\n</div></section><section

        id=\"fs-id2642520\">Are carbohydrates good for you? People who wish to lose
        weight are often told that carbohydrates are bad for them and should be avoided.
        Some diets completely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate
        diet helps people to lose weight faster. However, carbohydrates have been
        an important part of the human diet for thousands of years; artifacts from
        ancient civilizations show the presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors&#8217;
        storage areas.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1760576\">Carbohydrates should be supplemented
        with proteins, vitamins, and fats to be parts of a well-balanced diet. Calorie-wise,
        a gram of carbohydrate provides 4.3 Kcal. For comparison, fats provide 9 Kcal/g,
        a less desirable ratio. Carbohydrates contain soluble and insoluble elements;
        the insoluble part is known as fiber, which is mostly cellulose. Fiber has
        many uses; it promotes regular bowel movement by adding bulk, and it regulates
        the rate of consumption of blood glucose. Fiber also helps to remove excess
        cholesterol from the body: fiber binds to the cholesterol in the small intestine,
        then attaches to the cholesterol and prevents the cholesterol particles from
        entering the bloodstream, and then cholesterol exits the body via the feces.
        Fiber-rich diets also have a protective role in reducing the occurrence of
        colon cancer. In addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives
        a feeling of fullness. As an immediate source of energy, glucose is broken
        down during the process of cellular respiration, which produces ATP, the energy
        currency of the cell. Without the consumption of carbohydrates, the availability
        of &#8220;instant energy&#8221; would be reduced. Eliminating carbohydrates
        from the diet is not the best way to lose weight. A low-calorie diet that
        is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meat, together with
        plenty of exercise and plenty of water, is the more sensible way to lose weight.</p>\n\n<div

        are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell
        and provide structural support to plant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods
        that include lobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders. Carbohydrates
        are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending
        on the number of monomers in the molecule. Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic
        bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides
        and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond
        formed. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas
        common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Starch and glycogen,
        examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and
        animals, respectively. The long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched.
        Cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin,
        a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. Storage of glucose,
        in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible
        for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or
        creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by
        the cell.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167066831137\"

        also are sources of energy that power cellular processes. Like carbohydrates,
        lipids are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but these atoms are arranged
        differently. Most lipids are nonpolar and hydrophobic. Major types include
        fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. A typical fat consists
        of three fatty acids bonded to one molecule of glycerol, forming triglycerides
        or triacylglycerols. The fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, depending
        on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain; a saturated
        fatty acid has the maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon and,
        thus, only single bonds. In general, fats that are liquid at room temperature
        (e.g., canola oil) tend to be more unsaturated than fats that are solid at
        room temperature. In the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated
        to make them chemically more appropriate for use in processed foods. During
        this hydrogenation process, double bonds in the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon
        chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans- conformation; unfortunately,
        trans fats have been shown to contribute to heart disease. Phospholipids are
        a special type of lipid associated with cell membranes and typically have
        a glycerol (or sphingosine) backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a
        phosphate-containing group are attached. As a result, phospholipids are considered
        amphipathic because they have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components.
        (In Chapters 4 and 5 we will explore in more detail how the amphipathic nature
        of phospholipids in plasma cell membranes helps regulate the passage of substances
        into and out of the cell.) Although the molecular structures of steroids differ
        from that of triglycerides and phospholipids, steroids are classified as lipids
        based on their hydrophobic properties. Cholesterol is a type of steroid in
        animal cells&#146; plasma membrane.  Cholesterol is also the precursor of
        steroid hormones such as testosterone.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065857573\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">Information

        include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature.
        This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon&#8211;carbon
        or carbon&#8211;hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (&#8220;water
        fearing&#8221;), or insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions
        in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats. Lipids
        also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (<a href=\"#fs-id1167065851476\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). For example, their water-repellant
        hydrophobic nature can help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry by forming
        a protective layer over fur or feathers. Lipids are also the building blocks
        of many hormones and an important constituent of all cellular membranes. Lipids
        include fats, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.</p><div data-type=\"note\"

        and an oil is the state of the compound at room temperature (68&#176;F). A
        fat is a solid or semisolid material and an oil is a liquid at this temperature.
        Both fats and oils are made up of glycerol and two or three fatty acid chains
        attached to its carbons by way of dehydration synthesis. A fatty acid is a
        chain of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached at the open bonding sites.
        If the chain is fully saturated with hydrogen atoms, it is termed a saturated
        fat. This tends to give the compound a relatively stiff configuration and
        helps it to be a solid. If any of the hydrogen atoms are missing, it is called
        an unsaturated fat or oil. The absence of hydrogen atoms along the chain causes
        double bonds to form between adjacent carbon atoms, which results in a bend
        in the chain. This causes the molecules to push away other molecules near
        it, preventing the packing of fatty acid chains, and resulting in a liquid
        at room temperature. Fats tend to contain a high concentration of saturated
        fatty acids and oils tend to contain more unsaturated fatty acid chains. Both
        types have an effect on health; a high amount of saturated fats is significantly
        less healthy than a higher amount of unsaturated lipids. An exception trans
        fat, an unsaturated fat found in processed foods. Trans fats behave like a

        single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature.
        Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid (common in meat) and the fat
        with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. Mammals
        store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy
        most of the cell&#8217;s volume. In plants, fat or oil is stored in many seeds
        and is used as a source of energy during seedling development. Unsaturated

        which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in

        in water. All steroids have four linked carbon rings and several of them,
        like cholesterol, have a short tail (<a href=\"#fs-id1167065768595\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Many steroids also have the &#8211;OH functional group, which puts them in
        the alcohol classification (sterols).</p><figure id=\"fs-id1167065768595\"

        id=\"fs-id1473085\">Cholesterol is the most common steroid. Cholesterol is
        mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor to many steroid hormones
        such as testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the gonads and endocrine
        glands. It is also the precursor to Vitamin D. Cholesterol is also the precursor
        of bile salts, which help in the emulsification of fats and their subsequent
        absorption by cells. Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms
        by lay people, it is necessary for proper functioning of the body. It is a
        component of the plasma membrane of animal cells and is found within the phospholipid
        bilayer. Being the outermost structure in animal cells, the plasma membrane
        is responsible for the transport of materials and cellular recognition and
        it is involved in cell-to-cell communication.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\"

        a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major
        types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats are
        a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or triglycerides.
        Fats are made up of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine. Fatty
        acids may be unsaturated or saturated, depending on the presence or absence
        of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. If only single bonds are present,
        they are known as saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids may have
        one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Phospholipids make up the
        matrix of membranes. They have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which
        two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached. Steroids
        are another class of lipids. Their basic structure has four fused carbon rings.
        Cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma
        membrane, where it helps to maintain the fluid nature of the membrane. It
        is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section

        are long chains of different sequences of the 20 amino acids that each contain
        an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a variable
        group. (Think of how many protein &#8220;words&#8221; can be made with 20
        amino acid &#8220;letters&#8221;). Each amino acid is linked to its neighbor
        by a peptide bond formed by a dehydration reaction. A long chain of amino
        acids is known as a polypeptide. Proteins serve many functions in cells. They
        act as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions, provide structural support,
        regulate the passage of substances across the cell membrane, protect against
        disease, and coordinate cell signaling pathways. Protein structure is organized
        at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary
        structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. A change in just one amino
        acid can change protein structure and function. For example, sickle cell anemia
        results from just one amino acid substitution in a hemoglobin molecule consisting
        of 574 amino acids. The secondary structure consists of the local folding
        of the polypeptide by hydrogen bond formation; leading to the &#945; helix
        and &#946; pleated sheet conformations. In the tertiary structure, various
        interactions, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide linkages, and hydrophobic
        interactions between R groups, contribute to the folding of the polypeptide
        into different three-dimensional configurations. Most enzymes are of tertiary
        configuration. If a protein is denatured, loses its three-dimensional shape,
        it may no longer be functional. Environmental conditions such as temperature
        and pH can denature proteins. Some proteins, such as hemoglobin, are formed
        from several polypeptides, and the interactions of these subunits form the
        quaternary structure of proteins.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066792550\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">Information

        proteins have a variety of functions in the body. Table 3.1 contains some
        examples of these functions. Note that not all enzymes work under the same
        conditions. Amylase only works in an alkaline medium, such as in saliva, while
        pepsin works in the acid environment of the stomach. Discuss other materials
        that can be carried by protein in body fluids in addition to the substances
        listed for transport in the text.  Proteins also carry insoluble lipids in
        the body and transport charged ions, such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
        Discuss another important structural protein, collagen, as it is found throughout

        becoming negatively charged. This results in the amphipathic characteristic
        of amino acids and gives the compounds solubility in water. The presence of

        it occurs in three to four discrete steps. In reality, the structural changes
        that result in a functional protein occur on a continuum. As the primary structure
        is formed off the ribosomes, the polypeptide chain goes through changes until
        the final configuration is achieved. Have the students imagine a strand of
        spaghetti as it cooks in a clear pot. Initially, the strand is straight (ignore
        the stiffness for this example). While it cooks, the strand will bend and
        twist and (again, for this example), fold itself into a loose ball made up
        of the strand of pasta. The resulting strand has a particular shape. Ask the
        students what types of chemical bonds or forces might affect protein structure.
        These shapes are dictated by the position of amino acids along the strand.
        Other forces will complete the folding and maintain the structure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<section

        most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse
        range of functions of all macromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory,
        contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes;
        or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain
        thousands of proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like
        their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids,
        arranged in a linear sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2862975\"><span data-type=\"term\">Enzymes</span>,
        which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions
        (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins. Each enzyme
        is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts
        on. The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions.
        Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes
        that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic
        enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic
        enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction
        and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme
        is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of
        starch.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2781285\"><span data-type=\"term\">Hormones</span>
        are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted
        by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological
        processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For
        example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose
        level. The primary types and functions of proteins are listed in <a href=\"#tab-ch03-04-01\"

        some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature.
        For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our
        skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function, and
        this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. Changes
        in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes
        in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as <span data-type=\"term\">denaturation</span>.

        id=\"fs-id1953709\">The chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature
        of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).
        For example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the R group. Amino
        acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic
        in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar
        and have hydrophilic side chains. The side chains of lysine and arginine are
        positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic
        amino acids. Proline has an R group that is linked to the amino group, forming
        a ring-like structure. Proline is an exception to the standard structure of
        an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain (<a

        id=\"fs-id1506615\">Amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter
        or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known by the letter
        V or the three-letter symbol val. Just as some fatty acids are essential to
        a diet, some amino acids are necessary as well. They are known as essential
        amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine.
        Essential amino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins
        in the body, although not produced by the body; which amino acids are essential
        varies from organism to organism.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2235262\">The sequence

        formed by such linkages are called peptides. As more amino acids join to this
        growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a polypeptide. Each polypeptide
        has a free amino group at one end. This end is called the N terminal, or the
        amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as
        the C or carboxyl terminal. While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes
        used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids,
        whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have
        combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a
        distinct shape, and have a unique function. After protein synthesis (translation),
        most proteins are modified. These are known as post-translational modifications.
        They may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation, or may require the addition of
        other chemical groups. Only after these modifications is the protein completely
        functional.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id1281011\"

        found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion. This protein has a heme
        prosthetic group, and the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced
        and oxidized during electron transfer. Because this essential protein&#8217;s
        role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over
        millions of years. Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable
        amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence homology among different species;
        in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the similarities
        or differences among various species&#8217; DNA or protein sequences.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2216741\">Scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains
        104 amino acids. For each cytochrome c molecule from different organisms that
        has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position
        in all samples of cytochrome c. This indicates that there may have been a
        common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences,
        no sequence difference was found. When human and rhesus monkey sequences were
        compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid. In another comparison,
        human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position.</p>\n\n<div

        active site. If this active site is altered because of local changes or changes
        in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate.

        This structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide

        tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino
        acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described
        for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups with like charges
        are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to
        each other (ionic bonds). When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic
        R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas
        the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside. The former types of interactions
        are also known as hydrophobic interactions. Interaction between cysteine side

        id=\"fs-id2216009\">Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that
        are held together by chemical interactions. If the protein is subject to changes
        in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change,
        losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation.
        Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide
        is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the
        protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading
        to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when
        an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured
        when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures;
        for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function
        at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low
        pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the
        digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1958698\">Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally
        thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process.
        Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding
        process from protein helpers known as <span data-type=\"term\">chaperones</span>
        (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding
        process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the
        complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the
        target protein is folded.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        data-type=\"title\">Section Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id2335363\">Proteins are
        a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the
        cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting
        as enzymes, carriers, or hormones. The building blocks of proteins (monomers)
        are amino acids. Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an
        amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain.
        There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the
        R group. Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond. A long
        chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2199492\">Proteins
        are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional)
        quaternary. The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. The
        local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#945;</em>
        helix and <em data-effect=\"italics\">&#946;</em>-pleated sheet constitutes
        the secondary structure. The overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary
        structure. When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein
        structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein.
        Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused
        by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss
        in function.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167067077316\"

        acids (DNA and RNA) comprise the fourth group of biological macromolecules
        and contain phosphorus (P) in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
        Conserved through evolution in all organisms, nucleic acids store and transmit
        hereditary information. As will be explored in more detail in Chapters 14-17,
        DNA contains the instructions for the synthesis of proteins by dictating the
        sequences of amino acids in polypeptides through processes known as transcription
        and translation. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides; in turn, each nucleotide
        consists of a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA), a nitrogenous
        base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine or uracil), and a phosphate
        group. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell that is passed from parent
        to offspring via cell division. DNA has a double-helical structure with the
        two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel), connected by hydrogen
        bonds and complementary to each other. In DNA, purines pair with pyrimidines:
        adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). In
        RNA, uracil replaces thymine to pair with adenine (U-A). RNA also differs
        from DNA in that it is single-stranded and has many forms, such as messenger
        RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA) that all participate
        in the synthesis of proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the use of mRNA.
        The flow of genetic information is usually DNA &#8594; RNA &#8594; protein,
        also known as the Central Dogma of Life.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066809227\"

        usually exists as a single strand.  Messenger RNA (mRNA) can be found in the

        in DNA, and in the cytoplasm, where it delivers its message to ribosomes for
        protein assembly. Ribosomes are made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein.  Transfer
        RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to the ribosomes for attachment to a developing

        of nucleic acids are <span data-type=\"term\">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</span>
        and <span data-type=\"term\">ribonucleic acid (RNA)</span>. DNA is the genetic
        material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria
        to multicellular mammals. It is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in
        the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is
        not enclosed in a membranous envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id811873\">The entire
        genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes
        is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex
        with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes.
        A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the
        information to make protein products; other genes code for RNA products. DNA
        controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes &#8220;on&#8221;
        or &#8220;off.&#8221;</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1998871\">The other type of nucleic
        acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never
        leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the
        rest of the cell. This intermediary is the <span data-type=\"term\">messenger

        nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar,

        1&#8242; through 5&#8242; (the prime distinguishes these residues from those
        in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation). The base
        is attached to the 1&#8242; position of the ribose, and the phosphate is attached
        to the 5&#8242; position. When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5&#8242; phosphate
        of the incoming nucleotide attaches to the 3&#8242; hydroxyl group at the
        end of the growing chain. Two types of pentose are found in nucleotides, deoxyribose
        (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure
        to ribose, but it has an H instead of an OH at the 2&#8242; position. Bases
        can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have
        a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.</figcaption>\n<span

        hydrogen, and thus, decreases the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment,

        The difference between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on

        acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under
        the direction of DNA. RNA is usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides
        that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain
        contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A,
        U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2626112\">There are
        four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer
        RNA (tRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from
        DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires
        a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned &#8220;on&#8221;
        and the messenger RNA is synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence
        is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been
        copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If
        the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary
        RNA is UUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other
        cellular machinery (<a href=\"#fs-id1167067199541\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p><figure

        the protein product is made. <span data-type=\"term\">Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)</span>
        is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures
        the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome
        also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation
        of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids. <span data-type=\"term\">Transfer
        RNA (tRNA)</span> is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually
        70&#8211;90 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to the site
        of protein synthesis. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that
        allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain.
        microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves the regulation
        of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA messages.

        are molecules made up of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such
        as cell division and protein synthesis. Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose
        sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic
        acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed
        on from parents to offspring (in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical
        structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by
        hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and
        is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group.
        RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
        is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and
        contains information for the construction of proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
        is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer
        RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. microRNA
        regulates the use of mRNA for protein synthesis.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section

        every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Energy is needed
        to perform heavy labor and exercise. Humans also use a great deal of energy
        while thinking and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism
        constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported, metabolized
        (broken down), synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported
        around the cell, and, in some cases, distributed to the entire organism. For
        example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller
        molecules. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the
        cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish
        a building, energy is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules.
        Additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters are
        actively transported between cells. Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are ingested
        and broken down by cells. Cells must also export waste and toxins to stay
        healthy. Many cells swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion
        of cellular appendages such as cilia and flagella.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167064873440\">All
        of the cellular processes listed above require a steady supply of energy.
        From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain
        energy and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of
        energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065652126\">How
        enzymes lower the activation energy required to begin a chemical reaction
        in the body will also be discussed in this chapter. Enzymes are crucial for
        life; without them the chemical reactions required to survive would not happen
        fast enough for an organism to survive. For example, in an individual who
        lacks one of the enzymes needed to break down a type of carbohydrate known
        as a mucopolysaccharide, waste products accumulate in the cells and cause
        progressive brain damage. This deadly genetic disease is called Sanfilippo
        Syndrome type B or Mucopolysaccharidosis III. Previously incurable, scientists
        have now discovered a way to replace the missing enzyme in the brain of mice.

        have evolved various strategies to capture, store, transform, and transfer

        occur within it. Some metabolic reactions involve the breaking down of complex
        molecules into simpler ones with a release of energy (catabolism), whereas
        other metabolic reactions require energy to build complex molecules (anabolism).
        A central example of these pathways is the synthesis and breakdown of glucose.</p>\n<p

        id=\"fs-id1369040\">During the chemical reactions of photosynthesis, energy
        is provided in the form of a very high-energy molecule called ATP, or adenosine
        triphosphate, which is the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the
        dollar is used as currency to buy goods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy
        currency to perform immediate work. The sugar (glucose) is stored as starch
        or glycogen. Energy-storing polymers like these are broken down into glucose
        to supply molecules of ATP.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1804577\">Solar energy is required
        to synthesize a molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis.
        In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is initially transformed into
        chemical energy that is temporally stored in the energy carrier molecules
        ATP and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The stored energy
        in ATP and NADPH is then used later in photosynthesis to build one molecule
        of glucose from six molecules of CO<sub>2</sub>. This process is analogous
        to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire energy for your body that can
        be used later in the day. Under ideal conditions, energy from 18 molecules
        of ATP is required to synthesize one molecule of glucose during the reactions
        of photosynthesis. Glucose molecules can also be combined with and converted
        into other types of sugars. When sugars are consumed, molecules of glucose
        eventually make their way into each living cell of the organism. Inside the
        cell, each sugar molecule is broken down through a complex series of chemical
        reactions. The goal of these reactions is to harvest the energy stored inside
        the sugar molecules. The harvested energy is used to make high-energy ATP
        molecules, which can be used to perform work, powering many chemical reactions
        in the cell. The amount of energy needed to make one molecule of glucose from
        six molecules of carbon dioxide is 18 molecules of ATP and 12 molecules of
        NADPH (each one of which is energetically equivalent to three molecules of
        ATP), or a total of 54 ATP molecule equivalents required for the synthesis
        of one molecule of glucose. This process is a fundamental and efficient way
        for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require.</p>\n<figure

        processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types
        of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical
        reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step, through
        a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or
        products. In the case of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic pathway synthesized
        sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into
        smaller molecules. These two opposite processes&#8212;the first requiring
        energy and the second producing energy&#8212;are referred to as anabolic (building)
        and catabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively. Consequently, metabolism
        is composed of building (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism).</p>\n\n<div

        is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways
        alone. Metabolic complexity varies from organism to organism. Photosynthesis
        is the primary pathway in which photosynthetic organisms like plants (the
        majority of global synthesis is done by planktonic algae) harvest the sun&#8217;s
        energy and convert it into carbohydrates. The by-product of photosynthesis
        is oxygen, required by some cells to carry out cellular respiration. During
        cellular respiration, oxygen aids in the catabolic breakdown of carbon compounds,
        like carbohydrates. Among the products of this catabolism are CO<sub>2</sub>
        and ATP. In addition, some eukaryotes perform catabolic processes without
        oxygen (fermentation); that is, they perform or use anaerobic metabolism.</p><p
        id=\"fs-id1242559\">Organisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive
        (living organisms came into existence about 3.8 billion years ago, when the
        atmosphere lacked oxygen). Despite the differences between organisms and the
        complexity of metabolism, researchers have found that all branches of life
        share some of the same metabolic pathways, suggesting that all organisms evolved
        from the same ancient common ancestor (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_01_03\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Evidence indicates that over time, the pathways diverged, adding specialized
        enzymes to allow organisms to better adapt to their environment, thus increasing
        their chance to survive. However, the underlying principle remains that all
        organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it to ATP
        to carry out cellular functions.</p>\n<div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167067050678\"

        pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler
        ones. Synthesizing sugar from CO<sub>2</sub> is one example. Other examples
        are the synthesis of large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and the
        synthesis of new DNA strands from nucleic acid building blocks. These biosynthetic
        processes are critical to the life of the cell, take place constantly, and
        demand energy provided by ATP and other high-energy molecules like NADH (nicotinamide
        adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_01_04\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2315426\">ATP is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient
        supply at all times. The breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single molecule
        of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of ATP, 36 to 38 molecules.
        This is a <span data-type=\"term\">catabolic</span> pathway. Catabolic pathways
        involve the degradation (or breakdown) of complex molecules into simpler ones.
        Molecular energy stored in the bonds of complex molecules is released in catabolic
        pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be used to produce ATP. Other
        energy-storing molecules, such as fats, are also broken down through similar
        catabolic reactions to release energy and make ATP (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_01_04\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1235966\">It
        is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways don&#8217;t
        take place spontaneously. Each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed,
        by a protein called an enzyme. Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types
        of biological reactions&#8212;those that require energy as well as those that
        release energy.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch06_01_04\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch06-s01-lo02

        refers to the chemical reactions that take place within it. There are metabolic
        reactions that involve the breaking down of complex chemicals into simpler
        ones, such as the breakdown of large macromolecules. This process is referred

        for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066968329\">Although
        cells and organisms require free energy to survive, they cannot spontaneously
        create energy, as stated in the Law of Conservation of Energy. Energy is available
        in different forms. For example, objects in motion possess kinetic energy,
        whereas objects that are not in motion possess potential energy. The chemical
        energy in molecules, such as glucose, is potential energy because when bonds
        break in chemical reactions, free energy is released. Free energy is a measure
        of energy that is available to do work. The free energy of a system changes
        during energy transfers such as chemical reactions, and this change is referred
        to as &#916;G or Gibbs free energy. The &#916;G of a reaction can be negative
        or positive, depending on whether the reaction releases energy (exergonic)
        or requires energy input (endergonic). All reactions require an input of energy
        called activation energy in order to reach the transition state at which they
        will proceed. (In another section, we will explore how enzymes speed up chemical
        reactions by lowering activation energy barriers.)</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167067199564\"

        is defined as the ability to do work. As you&#8217;ve learned, energy exists
        in different forms. For example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat
        energy are all different types of energy. While these are all familiar types
        of energy that one can see or feel, there is another type of energy that is
        much less tangible. This energy is associated with something as simple as
        an object held above the ground. In order to appreciate the way energy flows
        into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand more about
        the different types of energy that exist in the physical world.</p>\n\n<section

        Energy</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id1437457\">When an object is in motion, there is
        energy associated with that object. In the example of an airplane in flight,
        there is a great deal of energy associated with the motion of the airplane.
        This is because moving objects are capable of enacting a change, or doing
        work. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a
        great deal of damage to other objects. However, a wrecking ball that is not
        in motion is incapable of performing work. Energy associated with objects
        in motion is called <span data-type=\"term\">kinetic energy</span>. A speeding
        bullet, a walking person, the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which
        produces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic
        energy.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2054126\">Now what if that same motionless wrecking
        ball is lifted two stories above a car with a crane? If the suspended wrecking
        ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The
        suspended wrecking ball has energy associated with it that is fundamentally
        different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion. This form of energy
        results from the fact that there is the <em data-effect=\"italics\">potential</em>
        for the wrecking ball to do work. If it is released, indeed it would do work.
        Because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work, it is called
        <span data-type=\"term\">potential energy</span>. Objects transfer their energy
        between kinetic and potential in the following way: As the wrecking ball hangs
        motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy. Once it is
        released, its kinetic energy begins to increase because it builds speed due
        to gravity. At the same time, as it nears the ground, it loses potential energy.
        Somewhere mid-fall it has 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy.
        Just before it hits the ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy
        and has near-maximal kinetic energy. Other examples of potential energy include
        the energy of water held behind a dam (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_02_01\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>),
        or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch06_02_01\"

        id=\"fs-id2170204\">Potential energy is not only associated with the location
        of matter (such as a child sitting on a tree branch), but also with the structure
        of matter. A spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed;
        so does a rubber band that is pulled taut. The very existence of living cells
        relies heavily on structural potential energy. On a chemical level, the bonds
        that hold the atoms of molecules together have potential energy. Remember
        that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex molecules
        from simpler ones, and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules
        are broken down. The fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of
        certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential energy. In
        fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules
        we eat, which is eventually harnessed for use. This is because these bonds
        can release energy when broken. The type of potential energy that exists within
        chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called <span
        data-type=\"term\">chemical energy</span> (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_02_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from
        food. The release of energy is brought about by breaking the molecular bonds
        within fuel molecules.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch06_02_02\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch06-s02-lo02\"><figcaption>The

        Energy</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id2051640\">After learning that chemical reactions
        release energy when energy-storing bonds are broken, an important next question
        is how is the energy associated with chemical reactions quantified and expressed?
        How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another
        reaction? A measurement of <span data-type=\"term\">free energy</span> is
        used to quantitate these energy transfers. Free energy is called Gibbs free
        energy (abbreviated with the letter G) after Josiah Willard Gibbs, the scientist
        who developed the measurement. Recall that according to the second law of
        thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy
        in an unusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. Gibbs free energy
        specifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that
        is available after entropy is accounted for. In other words, Gibbs free energy
        is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1896127\">Every
        chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta G (&#8710;G).
        The change in free energy can be calculated for any system that undergoes
        such a change, such as a chemical reaction. To calculate &#8710;G, subtract
        the amount of energy lost to entropy (denoted as &#8710;S) from the total
        energy change of the system. This total energy change in the system is called
        <span data-type=\"term\">enthalpy</span> and is denoted as &#8710;H . The
        formula for calculating &#8710;G  is as follows, where the symbol T refers
        to absolute temperature in Kelvin (degrees Celsius + 273):</p>\n<div data-type=\"equation\"

        standard free energy change of a chemical reaction is expressed as an amount
        of energy per mole of the reaction product (either in kilojoules or kilocalories,
        kJ/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal) under standard pH, temperature, and
        pressure conditions. Standard pH, temperature, and pressure conditions are
        generally calculated at pH 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees Celsius,
        and 100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively.  It is important to note
        that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions,
        and so standard calculated &#8710;G  values for biological reactions will
        be different inside the cell.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-id1394781\"

        Reactions and Exergonic Reactions</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1236680\">If energy is
        released during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above
        equation will be a negative number. In other words, reactions that release
        energy have a &#8710;G &lt; 0. A negative &#8710;G  also means that the products
        of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants, because they gave
        off some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a negative &#8710;G  and
        consequently release free energy are called <span data-type=\"term\">exergonic
        reactions</span>. Think: <em data-effect=\"italics\">ex</em>ergonic means
        energy is <em data-effect=\"italics\">ex</em>iting the system. These reactions
        are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without
        the addition of energy into the system. Understanding which chemical reactions
        are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists,
        because these reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell.
        An important distinction must be drawn between the term spontaneous and the
        idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. Contrary to the everyday
        use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly
        occurs. The rusting of iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that occurs
        slowly, little by little, over time.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1406190\">If a chemical
        reaction requires an input of energy rather than releasing energy, then the
        &#8710;G  for that reaction will be a positive value. In this case, the products
        have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, the products of these reactions
        can be thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are
        called <span data-type=\"term\">endergonic reactions</span>, and they are
        non-spontaneous. An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without
        the addition of free energy.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1235966\">Let&#8217;s revisit
        the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose.
        Remember that the building of complex molecules, such as sugars, from simpler
        ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. Therefore, the chemical reactions
        involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. On the other hand,
        the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler molecules releases
        energy in a series of exergonic reactions. Like the example of rust above,
        the breakdown of sugar involves spontaneous reactions, but these reactions
        don&#8217;t occur instantaneously.  <a href=\"#fig-ch06_02_03\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>
        shows some other examples of endergonic and exergonic reactions. Later sections
        will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous
        reactions happen more efficiently.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        id=\"fs-id1485321\">An important concept in the study of metabolism and energy
        is that of chemical equilibrium. Most chemical reactions are reversible. They
        can proceed in both directions, releasing energy into their environment in
        one direction, and absorbing it from the environment in the other direction
        (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_02_04\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        The same is true for the chemical reactions involved in cell metabolism, such
        as the breaking down and building up of proteins into and from individual
        amino acids, respectively. Reactants within a closed system will undergo chemical
        reactions in both directions until a state of equilibrium is reached. This
        state of equilibrium is one of the lowest possible free energy and a state
        of maximal entropy. Energy must be put into the system to push the reactants
        and products away from a state of equilibrium. Either reactants or products
        must be added, removed, or changed. If a cell were a closed system, its chemical
        reactions would reach equilibrium, and it would die because there would be
        insufficient free energy left to perform the work needed to maintain life.
        In a living cell, chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium,
        but never reach it. This is because a living cell is an open system. Materials
        pass in and out, the cell recycles the products of certain chemical reactions
        into other reactions, and chemical equilibrium is never reached. In this way,
        living organisms are in a constant energy-requiring, uphill battle against
        equilibrium and entropy. This constant supply of energy ultimately comes from
        sunlight, which is used to produce nutrients in the process of photosynthesis.</p>\n<figure

        is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic
        and exergonic reactions. Even exergonic reactions require a small amount of
        energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing
        steps. These reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some
        energy in the beginning. This small amount of energy input necessary for all
        chemical reactions to occur is called the <span data-type=\"term\">activation
        energy</span> (or free energy of activation) and is abbreviated E<sub>A</sub>
        (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_02_05\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1439064\">Why would an energy-releasing, negative &#8710;G reaction
        actually require some energy to proceed? The reason lies in the steps that
        take place during a chemical reaction. During chemical reactions, certain
        chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed. For example, when a glucose
        molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule are
        broken. Since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken.
        However, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule
        must be somewhat contorted. A small energy input is required to achieve this
        contorted state. This contorted state is called the <span data-type=\"term\">transition
        state</span>, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. For this reason, reactant
        molecules don&#8217;t last long in their transition state, but very quickly
        proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction. Free energy diagrams illustrate
        the energy profiles for a given reaction. Whether the reaction is exergonic
        or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at
        a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. However,
        regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at
        a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, E<sub>A</sub> is always
        positive.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id1805336\"

        does the activation energy required by chemical reactants come from? The source
        of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat
        energy from the surroundings. <span data-type=\"term\">Heat energy</span>
        (the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction) speeds
        up the motion of molecules, increasing the frequency and force with which
        they collide; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly,
        helping them reach their transition state. For this reason, heating up a system
        will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently.
        Increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect. Once reactants have
        absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition
        state, the reaction will proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1768863\">The activation
        energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed.
        The higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction will be.
        The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. This
        reaction occurs slowly over time because of its high E<sub>A</sub>. Additionally,
        the burning of many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will take place at
        a negligible rate unless their activation energy is overcome by sufficient
        heat from a spark. Once they begin to burn, however, the chemical reactions
        release enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation
        energy for surrounding fuel molecules. Like these reactions outside of cells,
        the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy
        to overcome at efficient rates. In other words, in order for important cellular
        reactions to occur at appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time),
        their activation energies must be lowered (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_02_05\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>);
        this is referred to as catalysis. This is a very good thing as far as living
        cells are concerned. Important macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and
        RNA, store considerable energy, and their breakdown is exergonic. If cellular
        temperatures alone provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions
        to overcome their activation barriers, the essential components of a cell
        would disintegrate.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        ground level. This would increase the amount of free energy available at ground
        level. The rates of growth of plants would increase due to the increase in
        free energy available. The increased metabolic rates of plants would eventually
        deplete soil nutrients leading to a decrease in the number and quality of
        plants in the area. This would lead to a decrease in free energy as vegetation

        Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id2000265\">Energy comes in many different forms. Objects
        in motion do physical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects in
        motion. Objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work,
        and thus, have potential energy. Molecules also have potential energy because
        the breaking of molecular bonds has the potential to release energy. Living
        cells depend on the harvesting of potential energy from molecular bonds to
        perform work. Free energy is a measure of energy that is available to do work.
        The free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as chemical
        reactions, and this change is referred to as &#8710;G.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1343175\">The
        &#8710;G  of a reaction can be negative or positive, meaning that the reaction
        releases energy or consumes energy, respectively. A reaction with a negative
        &#8710;G  that gives off energy is called an exergonic reaction. One with
        a positive &#8710;G  that requires energy input is called an endergonic reaction.
        Exergonic reactions are said to be spontaneous, because their products have
        less energy than their reactants. The products of endergonic reactions have
        a higher energy state than the reactants, and so these are nonspontaneous
        reactions. However, all reactions (including spontaneous &#8211;&#8710;G  reactions)
        require an initial input of energy in order to reach the transition state,
        at which they&#8217;ll proceed. This initial input of energy is called the
        activation energy.</p></section>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167066870214\"

        energy, scientists use the term system to refer to the matter and its environment
        involved in energy transfers, such as an ecosystem. Even single cells are
        biological systems and all systems require energy to maintain order. The more
        ordered a system is, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder
        of the system. (Think of your bedroom as a system. On Sunday evening, you
        throw dirty clothes in the laundry basket, put books back on the shelves,
        and return dirty dishes to the kitchen. Cleaning your room requires an input
        of energy. What gradually happens as the week progresses? You guessed it:
        entropy.) All biological systems obey the laws of chemistry and physics, including
        the laws of thermodynamics that describe the properties and processes of energy
        transfer in systems. The first law states that the total amount of energy
        in the universe is constant; energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it
        can be transformed and transferred. The second law states that every energy
        transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy,
        resulting in a more disordered system (e.g., your bedroom over the course
        of a week). Thus, no energy transfer is completely efficient.  (We will explore
        how free energy is stored, transferred, and used in more detail when we study
        photosynthesis and cellular respiration.)</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065910525\"

        data-type=\"term\">Thermodynamics</span> refers to the study of energy and
        energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its environment
        relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system,
        and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. For instance,
        when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the
        pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove,
        pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An open
        system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its
        surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the
        air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1870581\">Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged
        between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-storing molecules
        and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the
        physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics
        govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.</p>\n\n<section

        First Law of Thermodynamics</h1><p id=\"fs-id1445322\">The first law of thermodynamics
        deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. It states that this
        total amount of energy is constant. In other words, there has always been,
        and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe. Energy
        exists in many different forms. According to the first law of thermodynamics,
        energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different
        forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations
        of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical
        energy into light energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural
        gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy
        transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight into the
        chemical energy stored within organic molecules, as shown in <a href=\"/contents/29d90913-172b-4684-bd7d-c62ec7f639a0@29#fig-ch06_01_01\"
        class=\"has-default-text\">this figure</a>. Some examples of energy transformations

        id=\"fs-id1808182\">The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy
        from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform into
        usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge
        very well. Chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars
        and fats is transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into
        energy within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible
        to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building
        complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of
        cilia or flagella, contracting muscle fibers to create movement, and reproduction.</p>\n<figure

        id=\"fs-id2336465\">A living cell&#8217;s primary tasks of obtaining, transforming,
        and using energy to do work may seem simple. However, the second law of thermodynamics
        explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. None of the energy transfers
        we&#8217;ve discussed, along with all energy transfers and transformations
        in the universe, is completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount
        of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is
        heat energy. Thermodynamically, <span data-type=\"term\">heat energy</span>
        is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not
        doing work. For example, when an airplane flies through the air, some of the
        energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the
        surrounding air. This friction actually heats the air by temporarily increasing
        the speed of air molecules. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during
        cellular metabolic reactions. This is good for warm-blooded creatures like
        us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. Strictly speaking,
        no energy transfer is completely efficient, because some energy is lost in
        an unusable form.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1631701\">An important concept in physical
        systems is that of order and disorder (also known as randomness). The more
        energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and
        more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or
        disorder within a system as <span data-type=\"term\">entropy</span>. High
        entropy means high disorder and low energy (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_03_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        To better understand entropy, think of a student&#8217;s bedroom. If no energy
        or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy. It would exist
        in a very disordered state, one of high entropy. Energy must be put into the
        system, in the form of the student doing work and putting everything away,
        in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order. This
        state is one of low entropy. Similarly, a car or house must be constantly
        maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state. Left alone,
        the entropy of the house or car gradually increases through rust and degradation.
        Molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy as well.
        For example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases,
        and as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out,
        entropy also increases.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        physical systems can be thought of in this way: Living things are highly ordered,
        requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy.
        As living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through
        chemical reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process,
        because no reaction is completely efficient. They also produce waste and by-products
        that aren&#8217;t useful energy sources. This process increases the entropy
        of the system&#8217;s surroundings. Since all energy transfers result in the
        loss of some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states that every
        energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Even
        though living things are highly ordered and maintain a state of low entropy,
        the entropy of the universe in total is constantly increasing due to the loss
        of usable energy with each energy transfer that occurs. Essentially, living
        things are in a continuous uphill battle against this constant increase in
        universal entropy.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch06_03_02\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch06-s03-lo01\"><figcaption>Entropy

        data-type=\"title\">Section Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id1281011\">In studying
        energy, scientists use the term &#8220;system&#8221; to refer to the matter
        and its environment involved in energy transfers. Everything outside of the
        system is called the surroundings. Single cells are biological systems. Systems
        can be thought of as having a certain amount of order. It takes energy to
        make a system more ordered. The more ordered a system is, the lower its entropy.
        Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. As a system becomes more
        disordered, the lower its energy and the higher its entropy become.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2491691\">A series of laws, called the laws of thermodynamics, describe
        the properties and processes of energy transfer. The first law states that
        the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. This means that energy
        can&#8217;t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. The
        second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some
        loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a more
        disordered system. In other words, no energy transfer is completely efficient
        and tends toward disorder.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167065872980\"

        the energy &#147;currency&#148; or carrier of the cell. When cells require
        an input of energy, they use ATP. An ATP nucleotide molecule consists of a
        five-carbon sugar, the nitrogenous base adenine, and three phosphate groups.
        (Do not confuse ATP with the nucleotides of DNA and RNA, although they have
        structural similarities.) The bonds that connect the phosphate have high-energy
        content, and the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + P<sub>i</sub>
        (Adenosine Diphosphate + Pyrophosphate) is used to perform cellular work,
        such as contracting a muscle or pumping a solute across a cell membrane in
        active transport. Cells use ATP by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP
        hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, with ATP donating its phosphate group
        to another molecule via a process called phosphorylation. The phosphorylated
        molecule is at a higher energy state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated
        form and free energy is released to substrates to perform work during this
        process. Phosphorylation is an example of energy transfer between molecules.</p>\n<p

        Information\">\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066847650\">It is easy to say that ATP carries
        energy and transfers it to chemicals to fuel reactions. The hard part is in
        answering the question, how? All three phosphates are negatively charged and
        naturally repel each other. Energy is needed to keep them together. Line them
        up and the repelling forces increase and makes it difficult to get the third
        phosphate attached. This requires much more energy and creates an unstable
        bond. Energy is stored in this easily broken bond and can be passed on when
        the third phosphate is used to phosphorylate another compound. It brings the
        energy with it and losses some in the transfer, creating wasted energy as
        heat.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"fs-id2155409\">Even exergonic, energy-releasing
        reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed.
        However, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input,
        because their products have more free energy than their reactants. Within
        the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer
        lies with an energy-supplying molecule called <span data-type=\"term\">adenosine
        triphosphate</span>, or <span data-type=\"term\">ATP</span>. ATP is a small,
        relatively simple molecule (<a href=\"#fs-id1167067148019\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>),
        but within some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst
        of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. This molecule can
        be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way
        that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need. ATP
        is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.</p><figure

        is useful in illustrating the use of ATP in the sodium-potassium pump that

        suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three
        phosphate groups (<a href=\"#fs-id1167067148019\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a
        five-carbon sugar, ribose. The three phosphate groups, in order of closest
        to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma. Together,
        these chemical groups constitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds
        within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state. Both bonds
        that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds (<span data-type=\"term\">phosphoanhydride
        bonds</span>) that, when broken, release sufficient energy to power a variety
        of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds
        between the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between
        the first and second phosphate groups. The reason that these bonds are considered
        &#8220;high-energy&#8221; is because the products of such bond breaking&#8212;adenosine
        diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (P<sub>i</sub>)&#8212;have
        considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP and a water molecule.
        Because this reaction takes place with the use of a water molecule, it is
        considered a hydrolysis reaction. In other words, ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP
        in the following reaction:</p><div data-type=\"equation\" class=\"equation\"

        id=\"fs-id1780567\">Two prominent questions remain with regard to the use
        of ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy is released with
        the hydrolysis of ATP, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work?
        The calculated &#8710;G  for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP into ADP and
        P<sub>i</sub> is &#8722;7.3 kcal/mole (&#8722;30.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation
        is true under standard conditions, it would be expected that a different value
        exists under cellular conditions. In fact, the &#8710;G  for the hydrolysis
        of one mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard
        conditions: 14 kcal/mol (&#8722;57 kJ/mol).</p><p id=\"fs-id2018833\">ATP
        is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously
        dissociates into ADP + P<sub>i</sub>, and the free energy released during
        this process is lost as heat. The second question posed above, that is, how
        the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell,
        depends on a strategy called energy coupling. Cells couple the exergonic reaction
        of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed. One
        example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that
        is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>
        pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066807541\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). A large percentage of a cell&#8217;s
        ATP is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great
        deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out of the cell. The pump works
        constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. In
        order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing
        two K<sup>+</sup> ions), one molecule of ATP must be hydrolyzed. When ATP
        is hydrolyzed, its gamma phosphate doesn&#8217;t simply float away, but is
        actually transferred onto the pump protein. This process of a phosphate group
        binding to a molecule is called phosphorylation. As with most cases of ATP
        hydrolysis, a phosphate from ATP is transferred onto another molecule. In
        a phosphorylated state, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump has more free
        energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows
        it to release Na<sup>+</sup> to the outside of the cell. It then binds extracellular
        K<sup>+</sup>, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate
        to detach from the pump. This release of phosphate triggers the K<sup>+</sup>
        to be released to the inside of the cell. Essentially, the energy released
        from the hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with the energy required to power the
        pump and transport Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. ATP performs cellular
        work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.</p><div

        id=\"fs-id1242488\">Often during cellular metabolic reactions, such as the
        synthesis and breakdown of nutrients, certain molecules must be altered slightly
        in their conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction
        series. One example is during the very first steps of cellular respiration,
        when a molecule of the sugar glucose is broken down in the process of glycolysis.
        In the first step of this process, ATP is required for the phosphorylation
        of glucose, creating a high-energy but unstable intermediate. This phosphorylation
        reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated glucose
        molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose. Fructose is
        a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to move forward. Here, the exergonic
        reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting
        glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. Once again, the
        energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within ATP was used for the phosphorylation
        of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important
        conformational change.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        primary energy-supplying molecule for living cells. ATP is made up of a nucleotide,
        a five-carbon sugar, and three phosphate groups. The bonds that connect the
        phosphates (phosphoanhydride bonds) have high-energy content. The energy released
        from the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP + P<sub>i</sub> is used to perform cellular
        work. Cells use ATP to perform work by coupling the exergonic reaction of
        ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions. ATP donates its phosphate group
        to another molecule via a process known as phosphorylation. The phosphorylated
        molecule is at a higher-energy state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated
        form, and this added energy from the addition of the phosphate allows the
        molecule to undergo its endergonic reaction.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\"

        for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066046193\">Many chemical
        reactions in cells occur spontaneously, but happen too slowly to meet the
        needs of a cell. For example, a teaspoon of sucrose (table sugar), a disaccharide,
        in a glass of iced tea will take time to break down into two monosaccharides,
        glucose and fructose; however, if you add a small amount of the enzyme sucrase
        to the tea, sucrose breaks down almost immediately. Sucrase is an example
        of an enzyme, a type of biological catalyst. Enzymes are macromolecules&#151;most
        often proteins&#151;that speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation
        energy barriers. Enzymes are very specific for the reactions they catalyze;
        because they are polypeptides, enzymes can have a variety of shapes attributed
        to interactions among amino acid R-groups. One part of the enzyme, the active
        site, interacts with the substrate via the induced fit model of interaction.
        Substrate binding alters the shape of the enzyme to facilitate the chemical
        reaction in several different ways, including bringing substrates together
        in an optimal orientation. After the reaction finishes, the product(s) are
        released, and the active site returns to its original shape.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065893925\"
        class=\"ost-reading-discard\">Enzyme activity, and thus the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed
        reaction, is regulated by environmental conditions, including the amount of
        substrate, temperature, pH, and the presence of coenzymes, cofactors, activators,
        and inhibitors. Inhibitors, coenzymes, and cofactors can act competitively
        by binding to the enzyme&#146;s active site, or noncompetitively by binding
        to the enzyme&#146;s allosteric site. An allosteric site is an alternate part
        of the enzyme that can bind to non&#150;substrate molecules. Enzymes work
        most efficiently under optimal conditions that are specific to the enzyme.
        For example, trypsin, an enzyme in the human small intestine, works most efficiently
        at pH 8, whereas pepsin in the stomach works best under acidic conditions.
        Sometimes environmental factors, especially low pH and high temperatures,
        alter the shape of the active site; if the shape cannot be restored, the enzyme
        denatures. The most common method of enzyme regulation in metabolic pathways
        is via feedback inhibition. </p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1167066020780\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">How

        Alert\">\n<p id=\"fs-id1167065891394\">The idea that enzymes help chemical
        reactions to occur, but do not take part in the chemical reaction and are
        not changed by it can be confusing. Stress that an enzyme and substrate do
        not covalently bind to each other and the association is temporary. <a href=\"#fig-ch06_05_02\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> is useful in illustrating enzyme
        function. If two compounds are to be joined into one during the reaction,
        and they would anyway if left alone long enough, the enzyme molecule brings
        them close enough for the reaction to occur faster. If a large molecule is
        to be split into smaller units, the enzyme stresses the molecule and makes
        it easier for the covalent bonds holding the molecule to break. In both cases,
        the enzyme molecule subtlety changes its shape after attaching to the substrate
        (s). This creates an intermediate phase of the reaction and an enzyme-substrate
        complex. When the reaction is complete and the product(s) disassociate, the
        enzyme returns to its original shape.</p></div></div>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1910884\">A
        substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special
        molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions are called enzymes. Almost all
        enzymes are proteins, made up of chains of amino acids, and they perform the
        critical task of lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside
        the cell.  Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules, and holding
        them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming
        processes take place more readily. It is important to remember that enzymes
        don&#8217;t change the &#8710;G  of a reaction. In other words, they don&#8217;t
        change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is
        because they don&#8217;t change the free energy of the reactants or products.
        They only reduce the activation energy required to reach the transition state
        (<a href=\"#fs-id1167064994148\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p><figure

        Specificity</h1>\n<p id=\"fs-id2322412\">The chemical reactants to which an
        enzyme binds are the enzyme&#8217;s <span data-type=\"term\">substrates</span>.
        There may be one or more substrates, depending on the particular chemical
        reaction. In some reactions, a single-reactant substrate is broken down into
        multiple products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one
        larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction, both become modified,
        and leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where
        the substrate binds is called the enzyme&#8217;s <span data-type=\"term\">active
        site</span>. The active site is where the &#8220;action&#8221; happens, so
        to speak. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino
        acid residues (also called side chains, or R groups) within the active site.
        Each residue is characterized by different properties. Residues can be large
        or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or
        negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of amino acid residues,
        their positions, sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific
        chemical environment within the active site. This specific environment is
        suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates).
        Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates
        (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition state and the active
        site), enzymes are known for their specificity. The &#8220;best fit&#8221;
        results from the shape and the amino acid functional group&#8217;s attraction
        to the substrate. There is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate
        and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is flexibility as well.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1344546\">The fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to
        provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject
        to influences by the local environment. It is true that increasing the environmental
        temperature generally increases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise.
        However, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range
        can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are
        less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures will eventually cause
        enzymes, like other biological molecules, to <span data-type=\"term\">denature</span>,
        a process that changes the natural properties of a substance. Likewise, the
        pH of the local environment can also affect enzyme function. Active site amino
        acid residues have their own acidic or basic properties that are optimal for
        catalysis. These residues are sensitive to changes in pH that can impair the
        way substrate molecules bind. Enzymes are suited to function best within a
        certain pH range, and, as with temperature, extreme pH values (acidic or basic)
        of the environment can cause enzymes to denature.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\"

        id=\"fs-id2781386\">For many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate
        binding took place in a simple &#8220;lock-and-key&#8221; fashion. This model
        asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous
        step. However, current research supports a more refined view called <span
        data-type=\"term\">induced fit</span> (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_05_02\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        The induced-fit model expands upon the lock-and-key model by describing a
        more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate
        come together, their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzyme&#8217;s
        structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and
        the transition state of the substrate. This ideal binding maximizes the enzyme&#8217;s
        ability to catalyze its reaction.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        id=\"fs-id2008559\">When an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate
        complex is formed. This complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction
        and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. On a basic level,
        enzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by
        bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. The appropriate
        region (atoms and bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the appropriate
        region of the other molecule with which it must react. Another way in which
        enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal
        environment within the active site for the reaction to occur. Certain chemical
        reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar environment.
        The chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino
        acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an
        enzyme&#8217;s specific substrates to react.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2865494\">You&#8217;ve
        learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the
        energy involved in manipulating or slightly contorting chemical bonds so that
        they can easily break and allow others to reform. Enzymatic action can aid
        this process. The enzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy
        by contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bond-breaking,
        helping to reach the transition state. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation
        energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself. The amino acid residues
        can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds
        with substrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. In these
        cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its
        original state at the completion of the reaction. One of the hallmark properties
        of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they
        catalyze. After an enzyme is done catalyzing a reaction, it releases its product(s).</p>\n<figure

        id=\"fs-id2115354\">It would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of
        the enzymes encoded in an organism&#8217;s genome existed in abundant supply
        and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all
        times. In reality, this is far from the case. A variety of mechanisms ensure
        that this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions vary from cell to
        cell, and change within individual cells over time. The required enzymes and
        energetic demands of stomach cells are different from those of fat storage
        cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive
        cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during the time
        that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these
        cellular demands and conditions vary, so do the amounts and functionality
        of different enzymes.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1422858\">Since the rates of biochemical
        reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine
        activation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning
        of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately determine which reactions
        will proceed and at which rates. This determination is tightly controlled.
        In certain cellular environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by
        environmental factors, like pH and temperature. There are other mechanisms
        through which cells control the activity of enzymes and determine the rates
        at which various biochemical reactions will occur.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\"

        of Enzymes by Molecules</h2><p id=\"fs-id1465037\">Enzymes can be regulated
        in ways that either promote or reduce their activity. There are many different
        kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms
        exist for doing so. In some cases of enzyme inhibition, for example, an inhibitor
        molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site
        and simply block the substrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme
        is inhibited through <span data-type=\"term\">competitive inhibition</span>,
        because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site
        binding (<a href=\"#fs-id1167065897726\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        On the other hand, in noncompetitive inhibition, an inhibitor molecule binds
        to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages
        to block substrate binding to the active site.</p><figure id=\"fs-id1167065897726\"

        (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_05_04\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide,
        meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric inhibitor
        binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly
        such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric
        activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations
        on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that
        increases the affinity of the enzyme&#8217;s active site(s) for its substrate(s).</p>\n<figure

        Discovery by Looking for Inhibitors of Key Enzymes in Specific Pathways</span>Enzymes
        are key components of metabolic pathways. Understanding how enzymes work and
        how they can be regulated is a key principle behind the development of many
        of the pharmaceutical drugs (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_05_05\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>)
        on the market today. Biologists working in this field collaborate with other
        scientists, usually chemists, to design drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1341136\">Consider
        statins for example&#8212;which is the name given to the class of drugs that
        reduces cholesterol levels. These compounds are essentially inhibitors of
        the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme that synthesizes
        cholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the levels
        of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be reduced. Similarly, acetaminophen,
        popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme
        cyclooxygenase. While it is effective in providing relief from fever and inflammation
        (pain), its mechanism of action is still not completely understood.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2018996\">How are drugs developed? One of the first challenges in
        drug development is identifying the specific molecule that the drug is intended
        to target. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target. Drug
        targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying
        the target alone is not sufficient; scientists also need to know how the target
        acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in the case of disease. Once
        the target and the pathway are identified, then the actual process of drug
        design begins. During this stage, chemists and biologists work together to
        design and synthesize molecules that can either block or activate a particular
        reaction. However, this is only the beginning: both if and when a drug prototype
        is successful in performing its function, then it must undergo many tests
        from in vitro experiments to clinical trials before it can get FDA approval
        to be on the market.</p>\n<div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167065865711\"

        don&#8217;t work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific
        non-protein helper molecules, either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen
        bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Two types of helper
        molecules are <span data-type=\"term\">cofactors</span> and <span data-type=\"term\">coenzymes</span>.
        Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for
        their respective enzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (Fe++)
        and magnesium (Mg++). One example of an enzyme that requires a metal ion as
        a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules, DNA polymerase, which
        requires bound zinc ion (Zn++) to function. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules,
        with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and hydrogen, which are required
        for enzyme action. The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins
        (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_05_06\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).
        Some vitamins are precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes.
        Vitamin C is a coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part in building the
        important connective tissue component, collagen. An important step in the
        breakdown of glucose to yield energy is catalysis by a multi-enzyme complex
        called pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a complex of several
        enzymes that actually requires one cofactor (a magnesium ion) and five different
        organic coenzymes to catalyze its specific chemical reaction. Therefore, enzyme
        function is, in part, regulated by an abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes,
        which are supplied primarily by the diets of most organisms.</p>\n<figure

        compartmentalized into different organelles. This allows for yet another level
        of regulation of enzyme activity. Enzymes required only for certain cellular
        processes can be housed separately along with their substrates, allowing for
        more efficient chemical reactions. Examples of this sort of enzyme regulation
        based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter
        stages of cellular respiration, which take place exclusively in the mitochondria,
        and the enzymes involved in the digestion of cellular debris and foreign materials,

        Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways</h2>\n<p id=\"fs-id1596004\">Molecules can
        regulate enzyme function in many ways. A major question remains, however:
        What are these molecules and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and
        coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as you&#8217;ve learned. What other
        molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation,
        and competitive and noncompetitive inhibition? The answer is that a wide variety
        of molecules can perform these roles. Some of these molecules include pharmaceutical
        and non-pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. Perhaps
        the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory molecules, with respect to
        cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions
        themselves. In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use
        the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.
        <span data-type=\"term\">Feedback inhibition</span> involves the use of a
        reaction product to regulate its own further production (<a href=\"#fig-ch06_05_07\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). The cell responds to the abundance
        of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic
        reactions. Such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their
        production through the mechanisms described above.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-ch06_05_07\"

        regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar,
        the process that produces ATP. In this way, when ATP is abundant, the cell
        can prevent its further production. Remember that ATP is an unstable molecule
        that can spontaneously dissociate into ADP. If too much ATP were present in
        a cell, much of it would go to waste. On the other hand, ADP serves as a positive
        allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes
        that are inhibited by ATP. Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared
        to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through the catabolism of
        sugar.</p>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\"

        not need or want them to react anymore? If enzymes could not be controlled,
        the reactions would continue until the substrates were depleted, which is
        not a good situation for a living organism. Competitive and noncompetitive
        inhibition explains the control of enzyme activity. Research several examples
        of both in living organisms and explain why they are necessary. Amino acid
        production is one useful example. Amino acids are required for protein production,
        but too high a level of any amino acid is toxic, so the pathways must be controlled.

        data-type=\"title\">Section Summary</h1><p id=\"fs-id2927047\">Enzymes are
        chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions at physiological temperatures
        by lowering their activation energy. Enzymes are usually proteins consisting
        of one or more polypeptide chains. Enzymes have an active site that provides
        a unique chemical environment, made up of certain amino acid R groups (residues).
        This unique environment is perfectly suited to convert particular chemical
        reactants for that enzyme, called substrates, into unstable intermediates
        called transition states. Enzymes and substrates are thought to bind with
        an induced fit, which means that enzymes undergo slight conformational adjustments
        upon substrate contact, leading to full, optimal binding. Enzymes bind to
        substrates and catalyze reactions in four different ways: bringing substrates
        together in an optimal orientation, compromising the bond structures of substrates
        so that bonds can be more easily broken, providing optimal environmental conditions
        for a reaction to occur, or participating directly in their chemical reaction
        by forming transient covalent bonds with the substrates.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id2155353\">Enzyme
        action must be regulated so that in a given cell at a given time, the desired
        reactions are being catalyzed and the undesired reactions are not. Enzymes
        are regulated by cellular conditions, such as temperature and pH. They are
        also regulated through their location within a cell, sometimes being compartmentalized
        so that they can only catalyze reactions under certain circumstances. Inhibition
        and activation of enzymes via other molecules are other important ways that
        enzymes are regulated. Inhibitors can act competitively, noncompetitively,
        or allosterically; noncompetitive inhibitors are usually allosteric. Activators
        can also enhance the function of enzymes allosterically. The most common method
        by which cells regulate the enzymes in metabolic pathways is through feedback
        inhibition. During feedback inhibition, the products of a metabolic pathway
        serve as inhibitors (usually allosteric) of one or more of the enzymes (usually
        the first committed enzyme of the pathway) involved in the pathway that produces
        them.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167065769732\"
