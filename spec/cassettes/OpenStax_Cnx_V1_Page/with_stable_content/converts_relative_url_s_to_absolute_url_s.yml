        students begin this chapter, they may wish to review the concepts of distance,
        displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, scalars, vectors, representing
        vectors, units of acceleration, and acceleration due to gravity. Explain that
        an object that is not moving is often described in physics as being at rest.
        </p><p id=\"eip-idp6494048\">Point out that we come across motion in our everyday
        lives; for instance, a dolphin jumping in water as shown in the photo. There
        are simple laws of physics that govern motion. These laws are universal; that
        is, they apply to every object in the universe. Much of the work done in describing
        motion was done by Sir Isaac Newton. This chapter is about motion, the causes
        of motion, and the universal laws of motion.</p></div><p id=\"eip-894\">Isaac
        Newton (1642&#8211;1727) was a natural philosopher; a great thinker who combined
        science and philosophy to try to explain the workings of nature on Earth and
        in the universe. His laws of motion were just one part of the monumental work
        that has made him legendary. The development of Newton&#8217;s laws marks
        the transition from the Renaissance period of history to the modern era. This
        transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people thought
        about the physical universe. Drawing upon earlier work by scientists Galileo
        Galilei and Johannes Kepler, Newton&#8217;s laws of motion allowed motion
        on Earth and in space to be predicted mathematically. In this chapter you
        will learn about force as well as Newton&#8217;s first, second, and third
        laws of motion.</p> \n\n</body>\n\n</html>", "subjects": ["Mathematics and

        id=\"eip-305\"><span data-type=\"term\">Force</span> is the cause of motion,
        and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a
        dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a
        satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes
        the way objects move&#8212;their velocity and their acceleration. <span data-type=\"term\">Dynamics</span>
        considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems.
        Newton&#8217;s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe
        the way that objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with
        other objects. They are also universal laws in that they apply everywhere
        on Earth as well as in space.</p><p id=\"eip-832\">A force pushes or pulls
        an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object
        such as a table, or an animate object such as a person. The pushing or pulling
        may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of the earth. Forces
        have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are
        stronger than others and can point in different directions. For example, a
        cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air.
        In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your
        arm. </p><p id=\"eip-860\">When multiple forces act on an object, the forces
        combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total,
        or <span data-type=\"term\">net force</span>. An <span data-type=\"term\">external
        force</span> is a force that acts on an object inside of the system from outside
        of the system. This is different than an internal force, which acts between
        objects that are both within the system. The <span data-type=\"term\">net
        external force</span> combines these two definitions; it is the total combined
        external force. We go into more detail about net force, external force, and
        net external force in the coming sections. In mathematical terms, two forces
        acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or negative).
        By convention, the negative sign is assigned to movement to the left or downward.
        If two forces pushing in opposite directions are added together, the larger
        force will be somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite
        direction. It is important to be consistent with your chosen coordinate system
        within a problem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the downward
        direction for velocity, then distance, force and acceleration should also
        be designated as negative in the downward direction.</p><div data-type=\"note\"

        a $125 million dollar satellite designed to monitor the Martian atmosphere.
        It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance.
        The American scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches,
        pounds . . .) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard Metric SI
        units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned,
        the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up flying into the Martian atmosphere.  The
        probe disintegrated. It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA&#8217;s

        Review vectors and how they are represented. Review vector addition. <span
        class=\"level-above\">[AL]</span> Ask students to give everyday examples of
        situations where multiple forces act together. Draw free-body diagrams for
        some of these situations.</p></div><p id=\"eip-177\">For our first example
        of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This gives us the opportunity
        to introduce a useful tool known as a <span data-type=\"term\">free-body diagram</span>.
        A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon (or free body)
        as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces)
        are shown and are represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These
        forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the
        body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body
        because they cancel each other out, as Newton&#8217;s third law will show.
        Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.\n</p><p
        id=\"eip-824\">Here are some things included in a free-body diagram:</p><ol

        shows the force of tension acting in the upward direction, opposite the force
        of gravity. These forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow
        pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing
        gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative
        magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Since forces are vectors, they add
        just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in
        <a href=\"#eip-idp140653750160320\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>,
        which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude.
        Since these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are
        perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.</p><p
        id=\"eip-287\">Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on
        something. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a
        magnet in the case of magnetic force or the gravitational pull of the earth
        in the case of gravitational force.</p><p id=\"eip-217\">In the next three
        sections on Newton&#8217;s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific
        types of forces&#8212;friction, the normal force, and the gravitational force.
        To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams
        to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.</p><div

        first glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday experience. You
        have probably noticed that a moving object will usually slow down and stop
        unless some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding why,
        for example, a sliding box slows down (seemingly on its own) is that a net
        external force acts on it to make it slow down. Without this net external
        force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity (as stated in
        Newton&#8217;s first law of motion). What force acts on the box to slow it
        down? It is called <span data-type=\"term\">friction</span>. Friction is an
        external force that acts opposite to the direction of motion (see <a href=\"#eip-idm20864848\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). Think of it as a resistance to
        motion that slows things down.</p>\n\n<p id=\"eip-66\">Friction:</p>\n\n<ol

        </h2><p id=\"eip-370\">Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned
        off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it to a stop.
        However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck slightly so that the
        puck experiences very little friction as it moves over the surface. With friction
        almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very little change in speed.
        On a frictionless surface, the puck would experience no net external force
        (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction). Additionally,
        if we know enough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects
        will slow down.</p>\n\n<p id=\"eip-114\">Now let&#8217;s think about another
        example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant velocity by applying
        a force of +50 N (the positive sign indicates by convention that the direction
        of motion is to the right). What is the force of friction that opposes the
        motion? The force of friction must be &#8722;50 N. Why? According to Newton&#8217;s
        first law of motion, any object moving at constant velocity has no net external
        force acting upon it, which means that the sum of the forces acting on the
        object must be zero. The mathematical way to say that no net external force
        acts on an object is Fnet = 0, or &#8721;F = 0. So if the man applies +50
        N of force, then the force of friction must be &#8722;50 N for the two forces
        to add up to zero (i.e., &#8220;cancel&#8221; each other). Whenever you encounter
        the phrase &#8220;at constant velocity,&#8221; Newton&#8217;s first law tells
        you that the net external force is zero.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"eip-idm83000688\"
        class=\"ost-tag-lo-k12phys-ch04-s02-lo01\"><figcaption>For a box sliding across
        a floor, friction acts in the direction opposite to the velocity.</figcaption><span

        force of friction depends on two things: the coefficient of friction and the
        normal force. The coefficient of friction is a constant that depends on the
        nature of the surfaces in contact with one another. The normal force is the
        force exerted by a surface that pushes on an object in response to gravity
        pulling the object down. In equation form, the force of friction is <div data-type=\"equation\"

        &#956; is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The coefficient
        of friction is discussed in more detail in the next chapter and the normal
        force is discussed in more detail in section four of this chapter.\n</p><p
        id=\"eip-89\">Recall from section one that a net external force acts from
        outside on the object of interest. A more precise definition is that it acts
        on the <span data-type=\"term\">system</span> of interest. A system is one
        or more objects that you choose to study. It is important to define the system
        at the beginning of a problem to figure out which forces are external and
        need to be considered and which are internal and can be ignored.</p><p id=\"eip-826\">For
        example, in <a href=\"#eip-idm20864848\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>
        (a), two children push a third child in a wagon at constant velocity. The
        system of interest is the wagon plus the small child shown in part b of the
        figure. The two children behind the wagon exert external forces on this system
        (F1, F2). Friction f acting at the axles of the wheels and at the surface
        where the wheels touch the ground is another external force acting on the
        system. Two more external forces act on the system: the weight W of the system
        pulling down and the normal force N of the ground pushing up. Notice that
        the wagon is not accelerating vertically, so Newton&#8217;s first law tells
        us that the normal force balances the weight. Because the wagon is moving
        forward at constant velocity, then the force of friction must have the same
        strength as the sum of the forces applied by the two children.</p>\n\n<figure
        id=\"eip-idm20864848\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-k12phys-ch04-s02-lo01\"><figcaption>(a)
        The wagon and rider form a &#8220;system&#8221; that is acted on by external
        forces. (b)The two children pushing the wagon and child provide two external
        forces. Friction acting at the wheel axles and on the surface of the tires
        where they touch the ground provides an external force that acts against the
        direction of motion. The weight W and the normal force N from the ground are
        two more external forces acting on the system. All external forces are represented
        in the figure by arrows. All of the external forces acting on the system add
        together, but because the wagon moves at a constant velocity, all the forces
        must add up to zero.</figcaption><span data-type=\"media\" id=\"eip-idp5554688\"

        an object at rest to remain at rest or for a moving object to remain in motion
        in a straight line with constant speed. This key property of objects was first
        described by Galileo. Later, Newton incorporated the concept of inertia into
        his first law, which is often referred to as the <span data-type=\"term\">law
        of inertia</span>.</p><p id=\"eip-36\">As we know from experience, some objects
        have more inertia than others. For example, changing the motion of a large
        truck is more difficult than changing the motion of a toy truck. In fact,
        the inertia of an object is proportional to the mass of the object. <span
        data-type=\"term\">Mass</span> is a measure of the amount of matter (or &#8220;stuff&#8221;)
        in something. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined
        by the number and type of atoms it contains. Unlike weight (which changes
        if the gravitational force changes), mass does not depend on gravity. The
        mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the
        Moon. In practice, it is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms
        and molecules in an object, so mass is usually not determined this way. Instead,
        the mass of an object is determined by comparing it with the standard kilogram.
        Mass is therefore expressed in kilograms.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" id=\"eip-idm961296\"

        it is derived from an object&#8217;s weight. Since the force of gravity is
