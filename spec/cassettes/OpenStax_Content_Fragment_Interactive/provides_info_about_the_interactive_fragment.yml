        must be a <em data-effect=\"italics\">cause</em> (which is a net external
        force) <em data-effect=\"italics\">for there to be any change in velocity
        (either a change in magnitude or direction)</em>. We will define <em data-effect=\"italics\">net
        external force</em> in the next section. An object sliding across a table
        or floor slows down due to the net force of friction acting on the object.
        If friction disappeared, would the object still slow down?</p><p id=\"import-auto-id1416969\"
        class=\" \">The idea of cause and effect is crucial in accurately describing
        what happens in various situations. For example, consider what happens to
        an object sliding along a rough horizontal surface. The object quickly grinds
        to a halt. If we spray the surface with talcum powder to make the surface
        smoother, the object slides farther. If we make the surface even smoother
        by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object slides farther yet. Extrapolating
        to a frictionless surface, we can imagine the object sliding in a straight
        line indefinitely. Friction is thus the <em data-effect=\"italics\">cause</em>
        <em data-effect=\"italics\"><!-- no-selfclose --></em>of the slowing (consistent
        with Newton\u2019s first law). The object would not slow down at all if friction
        were completely eliminated. Consider an air hockey table. When the air is
        turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it
        to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it creates a nearly frictionless
        surface, and the puck glides long distances without slowing down. Additionally,
        if we know enough about the friction, we can accurately predict how quickly
        the object will slow down. Friction is an external force. </p><p id=\"import-auto-id1486790\"
        class=\" \">Newton\u2019s first law is completely general and can be applied
        to anything from an object sliding on a table to a satellite in orbit to blood
        pumped from the heart. Experiments have thoroughly verified that any change
        in velocity (speed or direction) must be caused by an external force. The
        idea of <em data-effect=\"italics\">generally applicable or universal laws</em>
        is important not only here\u2014it is a basic feature of all laws of physics.
        Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns in nature from which further
        patterns can be discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first developed the
        idea for the first law, and Newton, who clarified it, was to ask the fundamental
        question, \u201cWhat is the cause?\u201d Thinking in terms of cause and effect
        is a worldview fundamentally different from the typical ancient Greek approach
        when questions such as \u201cWhy does a tiger have stripes?\u201d would have
        been answered in Aristotelian fashion, \u201cThat is the nature of the beast.\u201d
        True perhaps, but not a useful insight.</p>\n      \n        \n      \n        <section
        data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1737594\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Mass</h3>\n        <p
        id=\"import-auto-id2712510\" class=\" \">The property of a body to remain
        at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called <span data-type=\"term\"
        id=\"term90\" group-by=\"i\">inertia</span>. Newton\u2019s first law is often
        called the <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term91\" group-by=\"l\">law of inertia</span>.
        As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It
        is obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that
        of a basketball, for example. The inertia of an object is measured by its
        <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term92\" group-by=\"m\">mass</span>. Roughly
        speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of \u201cstuff\u201d (or matter)
        in something. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined
        by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it contains. Unlike
        weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same
        on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. In practice, it is very
        difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object,
        so masses are not often determined in this manner. Operationally, the masses
        of objects are determined by comparison with the standard kilogram.</p></section>\n        \n        <div
